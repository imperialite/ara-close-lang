            " comcore aftertwentyyears the policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively the impressiveness was habitual and not for show for spectators were few the time was barely o clock at night but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh de peopled the streets trying doors as he went twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare the officer with his stalwart form and slight swagger made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace the vicinity was one that kept early hours now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all night lunch counter but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed when about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk in the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned with an unlighted cigar in his mouth as the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly it s all right officer he said reassuringly i m just waiting for a friend it s an appointment made twenty years ago sounds a little funny to you doesn t it well i ll explain if you d like to make certain it s all straight about that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands big joe brady s restaurant until five years ago said the policeman it was torn down then the man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar the light showed a pale square jawed face with keen eyes and a little white scar near his right eyebrow his scarfpin was a large diamond oddly set twenty years ago to night said the man i dined here at big joe brady s with jimmy wells my best chum and the finest chap in the world he and i were raised here in new york just like two brothers together i was eighteen and jimmy was twenty the next morning i was to start for the west to make my fortune you couldn t have dragged jimmy out of new york he thought it was the only place on earth well we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come we figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made whatever they were going to be it sounds pretty interesting said the policeman rather a long time between meets though it seems to me haven t you heard from your friend since you left well yes for a time we corresponded said the other but after a year or two we lost track of each other you see the west is a pretty big proposition and i kept hustling around over it pretty lively but i know jimmy will meet me here if he s alive for he always was the truest stanchest old chap in the world he ll never forget i came a thousand miles to stand in this door to night and it s worth it if my old partner turns up the waiting man pulled out a handsome watch the lids of it set with small diamonds three minutes to ten he announced it was exactly ten o clock when we parted here at the restaurant door did pretty well out west didn t you asked the policeman you bet i hope jimmy has done half as well he was a kind of plodder though good fellow as he was i ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile a man gets in a groove in new york it takes the west to put a razor edge on him the policeman twirled his club and took a step or two i ll be on my way hope your friend comes around all right going to call time on him sharp i should say not said the other i ll give him half an hour at least if jimmy is alive on earth he ll be here by that time so long officer good night sir said the policeman passing on along his beat trying doors as he went there was now a fine cold drizzle falling and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow the few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands and in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment uncertain almost to absurdity with the friend of his youth smoked his cigar and waited about twenty minutes he waited and then a tall man in a long overcoat with collar turned up to his ears hurried across from the opposite side of the street he went directly to the waiting man is that you bob he asked doubtfully is that you jimmy wells cried the man in the door bless my heart exclaimed the new arrival grasping both the other s hands with his own it s bob sure as fate i was certain i d find you here if you were still in existence well well well twenty years is a long time the old restaurant s gone bob i wish it had lasted so we could have had another dinner there how has the west treated you old man bully it has given me everything i asked it for you ve changed lots jimmy i never thought you were so tall by two or three inches oh i grew a bit after i was twenty doing well in new york jimmy moderately i have a position in one of the city departments come on bob we ll go around to a place i know of and have a good long talk about old times the two men started up the street arm in arm the man from the west his egotism enlarged by success was beginning to outline the history of his career the other submerged in his overcoat listened with interest at the corner stood a drug store brilliant with electric lights when they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other s face the man from the west stopped suddenly and released his arm you re not jimmy wells he snapped twenty years is a long time but not long enough to change a man s nose from a roman to a pug it sometimes changes a good man into a bad one said the tall man you ve been under arrest for ten minutes silky bob chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you going quietly are you that s sensible now before we go on to the station here s a note i was asked to hand you you may read it here at the window it s from patrolman wells the man from the west unfolded the little piece of paper handed him his hand was steady when he began to read but it trembled a little by the time he had finished the note was rather short bob i was at the appointed place on time when you struck the match to light your cigar i saw it was the face of the man wanted in chicago somehow i couldn t do it myself so i went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job jimmy comcore awrinkleintime if we knew ahead of time what was going to happen we d be we d be like the people on camazotz with no lives of our own with everything all planned and done for us how can i explain it to you oh i know in your language you have a form of poetry called the sonnet yes yes calvin said impatiently what s that got to do with the happy medium kindly pay me the courtesy of listening to me mrs whatsit s voice was stern and for a moment calvin stopped pawing the ground like a nervous colt it is a very strict form of poetry is it not yes there are fourteen lines i believe all in iambic pentameter that s a very strict rhythm or meter yes yes calvin nodded no but within this strict form the poet has complete freedom to say whatever he wants doesn t he yes calvin nodded again so mrs whatsit said so what oh do not be stupid boy mrs whatsit scolded you know perfectly well what i am driving at you mean you re comparing our lives to a sonnet a strict form but freedom within it yes mrs whatsit said you re given the form but you have to write the sonnet yourself what you say is completely up to you comcore lifeoffrederickdouglass the plan which i adopted and the one by which i was most successful was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom i met in the street as many of these as i could i converted into teachers with their kindly aid obtained at different times and in different places i finally succeeded in learning to read when i was sent of errands i always took my book with me and by going one part of my errand quickly i found time to get a lesson before my return i used also to carry bread with me enough of which was always in the house and to which i was always welcome for i was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood this bread i used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins who in return would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge i am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection i bear them but prudence forbids not that it would injure me but it might embarrass them for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this christian country it is enough to say of the dear little fellows that they lived on philpot street very near durgin and bailey s ship yard i used to talk this matter of slavery over with them i would sometimes say to them i wished i could be as free as they would be when they got to be men you will be free as soon as you are twenty one but i am a slave for life have not i as good a right to be free as you have these words used to trouble them they would express for me the liveliest sympathy and console me with the hope that something would occur by which i might be free i was now about twelve years old and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily upon my heart just about this time i got hold of a book entitled the columbian orator every opportunity i got i used to read this book among much of other interesting matter i found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave the slave was represented as having run away from his master three times the dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them when the slave was retaken the third time in this dialogue the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master all of which was disposed of by the slave the slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master things which had the desired though unexpected effect for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master in the same book i met with one of sheridan s mighty speeches on and in behalf of catholic emancipation these were choice documents to me i read them over and over again with unabated interest they gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul which had frequently flashed through my mind and died away for want of utterance the moral which i gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder what i got from sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery and a powerful vindication of human rights the reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery but while they relieved me of one difficulty they brought on another even more painful than the one of which i was relieved the more i read the more i was led to abhor and detest my enslavers i could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers who had left their homes and gone to africa and stolen us from our homes and in a strange land reduced us to slavery i loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men as i read and contemplated the subject behold that very discontentment which master hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish as i writhed under it i would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing it had given me a view of my wretched condition without the remedy it opened my eyes to the horrible pit but to no ladder upon which to get out in moments of agony i envied my fellow slaves for their stupidity i have often wished myself a beast i preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own any thing no matter what to get rid of thinking it was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me there was no getting rid of it it was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing animate or inanimate the silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness freedom now appeared to disappear no more forever it was heard in every sound and seen in every thing it was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition i saw nothing without seeing it i heard nothing without hearing it and felt nothing without feeling it it looked from every star it smiled in every calm breathed in every wind and moved in every storm comcore bloodtoiltearsandsweat i say to the house as i said to ministers who have joined this government i have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat we have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind we have before us many many months of struggle and suffering you ask what is our policy i say it is to wage war by land sea and air war with all our might and with all the strength god has given us and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy you ask what is our aim i can answer in one word it is victory victory at all costs victory in spite of all terrors victory however long and hard the road may be for without victory there is no survival i take up my task in buoyancy and hope i feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men i feel entitled at this juncture at this time to claim the aid of all and to say come then let us go forward together with our united strength comcore travels with charley i soon discovered that if a wayfaring stranger wishes to eavesdrop on a local population the places for him to slip in and hold his peace are bars and churches but some new england towns don t have bars and church is only on sunday a good alternative is the roadside restaurant where men gather for breakfast before going to work or going hunting to find these places inhabited one must get up very early and there is a drawback even to this early rising men not only do not talk much to strangers they barely talk to one another breakfast conversation is limited to a series of laconic grunts the natural new england taciturnity reaches its glorious perfection at breakfast i am not normally a breakfast eater but here i had to be or i wouldn t see anybody unless i stopped for gas at the first lighted roadside restaurant i pulled in and took my seat at a counter the customers were folded over their coffee cups like ferns a normal conversation is as follows waitress same customer yep waitress cold enough for you customer yep ten minutes waitress refill customer yep this is a really talkative customer comcore ihaveadream i say to you today my friends even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi a state sweltering with the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character i have a dream today i have a dream that one day down in alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullificationone day right there in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers i have a dream today i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together this is our hope this is the faith that i go back to the south with with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood with this faith we will be able to work together to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together to stand up for freedom together knowing that we will be free one day this will be the day when all of god s children will be able to sing with new meaning my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims pride from every mountain side let freedom ring and if america is to be a great nation this must become true so let freedom ring from the prodigious hill tops of new hampshire let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york let freedom ring from heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania let freedom ring from the snowcapped rockies of colorado let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california but not only that let freedom ring from stone mountain of georgia let freedom ring from lookout mountain of tennessee let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippi from every mountainside let freedom ring and when we allow freedom to ring when we let it ring from every village from every hamlet from every state and every city we will be able to speed up that day when all of god s children black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old negro

them aloud she suggested that i try to make a sentence sound in as many different ways as possible i ll accept no excuse if you return a book to me that has been badly handled my imagination boggled at the punishment i would deserve if in fact i did abuse a book of mrs flowers death would be too kind and brief the odors in the house surprised me somehow i had never connected mrs flowers with food or eating or any other common experience of common people there must have been an outhouse too but my mind never recorded it the sweet scent of vanilla had met us as she opened the door i made tea cookies this morning you see i had planned to invite you for cookies and lemonade so we could have this little chat the lemonade is in the icebox it followed that mrs flowers would have ice on an ordinary day when most families in our town bought ice late on saturdays only a few times during the summer to be used in the wooden ice cream freezers she took the bags from me and disappeared through the kitchen door i looked around the room that i had never in my wildest fantasies imagined i would see browned photographs leered or threatened from the walls and the white freshly done curtains pushed against themselves and against the wind i wanted to gobble up the room entire and take it to bailey who would help me analyze and enjoy it have a seat marguerite over there by the table she carried a platter covered with a tea towel although she warned that she hadn t tried her hand at baking sweets for some time i was certain that like everything else about her the cookies would be perfect they were flat round wafers slightly browned on the edges and butter yellow in the center with the cold lemonade they were sufficient for childhood s lifelong diet remembering my manners i took nice little lady like bites off the edges she said she had made them expressly for me and that she had a few in the kitchen that i could take home to my brother so i jammed one whole cake in my mouth and the rough crumbs scratched the insides of my jaws and if i hadn t had to swallow it would have been a dream come true as i ate she began the first of what we later called my lessons in living she said that i must always be intolerant of ignorance but understanding of illiteracy that some people unable to go to school were more educated and even more intelligent than college professors she encouraged me to listen carefully to what country people called mother wit that in those homely sayings was couched the collective wisdom of generations comcore thefoxandthecrow a crow having stolen a bit of flesh perched in a tree and held it in her beak a fox seeing her longed to possess himself of the flesh and by a wily stratagem succeeded how handsome is the crow he exclaimed in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion oh if her voice were only equal to her beauty she would deservedly be considered the queen of birds this he said deceitfully having greater admiration for the meat than for the crow but the crow all her vanity aroused by the cunning flattery and anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice set up a loud caw and dropped the flesh the fox quickly picked it up and thus addressed the crow my good crow your voice is right enough but your wit is wanting he who listens to flattery is not wise for it has no good purpose comcore theemperorsnewclothes many years ago there was an emperor who was so excessively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes he had a different suit for each hour of the day and as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he is sitting in council it was always said of him the emperor is sitting in his wardrobe time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court one day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance they gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held or who was extraordinarily simple in character these must indeed be splendid clothes thought the emperor had i such a suit i might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish this stuff must be woven for me immediately and he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected to work very busily though in reality they did nothing at all they asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread put both into their own knapsacks and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night comcore theminotaur alas my son quoth king aegeus heaving a long sigh here is a very lamentable matter in hand this is the woefullest anniversary in the whole year it is the day when we annually draw lots to see which of the youths and maids of athens shall go to be devoured by the horrible minotaur the minotaur exclaimed prince theseus and like a brave young prince as he was he put his hand to the hilt of his sword what kind of a monster may that be is it not possible at the risk of one s life to slay him but king aegeus shook his venerable head and to convince theseus that it was quite a hopeless case he gave him an explanation of the whole affair it seems that in the island of crete there lived a certain dreadful monster called a minotaur which was shaped partly like a man and partly like a bull and was altogether such a hideous sort of a creature that it is really disagreeable to think of him if he were suffered to exist at all it should have been on some desert island or in the duskiness of some deep cavern where nobody would ever be tormented by his abominable aspect but king minos who reigned over crete laid out a vast deal of money in building a habitation for the minotaur and took great care of his health and comfort merely for mischief s sake a few years before this time there had been a war between the city of athens and the island of crete in which the athenians were beaten and compelled to beg for peace no peace could they obtain however except on condition that they should send seven young men and seven maidens every year to be devoured by the pet monster of the cruel king minos for three years past this grievous calamity had been borne and the sobs and groans and shrieks with which the city was now filled were caused by the people s woe because the fatal day had come again when the fourteen victims were to be chosen by lot and the old people feared lest their sons or daughters might be taken and the youths and damsels dreaded lest they themselves might be destined to glut the ravenous maw of that detestable man brute but when theseus heard the story he straightened himself up so that he seemed taller than ever before and as for his face it was indignant despiteful bold tender and compassionate all in one look let the people of athens this year draw lots for only six young men instead of seven said he i will myself be the seventh and let the minotaur devour me if he can o my dear son cried king aegeus why should you expose yourself to this horrible fate you are a royal prince and have a right to hold yourself above the destinies of common men it is because i am a prince your son and the rightful heir of your kingdom that i freely take upon me the calamity of your subjects answered theseus and you my father being king over these people and answerable to heaven for their welfare are bound to sacrifice what is dearest to you rather than that the son or daughter of the poorest citizen should come to any harm comcore genetics hatshepsut was a queen of egypt in the th century b c when her husband the pharaoh died hatshepsut s

with a light heart for what had i now to fear there entered three men who introduced themselves with perfect suavity as officers of the police a shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night suspicion of foul play had been aroused information had been lodged at the police office and they the officers had been deputed to search the premises i smiled for what had i to fear i bade the gentlemen welcome the shriek i said was my own in a dream the old man i mentioned was absent in the country i took my visitors all over the house i bade them search search well i led them at length to his chamber i showed them his treasures secure undisturbed in the enthusiasm of my confidence i brought chairs into the room and desired them here to rest from their fatigues while i myself in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim the officers were satisfied my manner had convinced them i was singularly at ease they sat and while i answered cheerily they chatted of familiar things but ere long i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone my head ached and i fancied a ringing in my ears but still they sat and still chatted the ringing became more distinct it continued and became more distinct i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued and gained definiteness until at length i found that the noise was not within my ears no doubt i now grew very pale but i talked more fluently and with a heightened voice yet the sound increased and what could i do it was a low dull quick sound much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i gasped for breath and yet the officers heard it not i talked more quickly more vehemently but the noise steadily increased i arose and argued about trifles in a high key and with violent gesticulations but the noise steadily increased why would they not be gone i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides as if excited to fury by the observations of the men but the noise steadily increased oh god what could i do i foamed i raved i swore i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting and grated it upon the boards but the noise arose over all and continually increased it grew louder louder louder and still the men chatted pleasantly and smiled was it possible they heard not almighty god no no they heard they suspected they knew they were making a mockery of my horror this i thought and this i think but anything was better than this agony anything was more tolerable than this derision i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer i felt that i must scream or die and now again hark louder louder louder louder villains i shrieked dissemble no more i admit the deed tear up the planks here here it is the beating

three and two and one and when you wake up on your eleventh birthday you expect to feel eleven but you don t you open your eyes and everything s just like yesterday only it s today and you don t feel eleven at all you feel like you re still ten and you are underneath the year that makes you eleven like some days you might say something stupid and that s the part of you that s still ten or maybe some days you might need to sit on your mama s lap because you re scared and that s the part of you that s five and maybe one day when you re all grown up maybe you will need to cry like if you re three and that s okay that s what i tell mama when she s sad and needs to cry maybe she s feeling three because the way you grow old is kind of like an onion or like the rings inside a tree trunk or like my little wooden dolls that fit one inside the other each year inside the next one that s how being eleven years old is you don t feel eleven not right away it takes a few days weeks even

d brandeis fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly men feared witches and burnt women it is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears to justify suppression of free speech there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced there must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended is imminent there must be reasonable ground to believe that the evil to be prevented is a serious one every denunciation of existing law tends in some measure to increase the probability that there will be violation of it condonation of a breach enhances the probability expressions of approval add to the probability propagation of the criminal state of mind by teaching syndicalism increases it advocacy of law breaking heightens it still further but even advocacy of violation however reprehensible morally is not a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on the wide difference between advocacy and incitement between preparation and attempt between assembling and conspiracy must be borne in mind in order to support a finding of clear and present danger it must be shown either that immediate serious violence was to be expected or was advocated or that the past conduct furnished reason to believe that such advocacy was then contemplated those who won our independence by revolution were not cowards they did not fear political change they did not exalt order at the cost of liberty to courageous self reliant men with confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning applied through the processes of popular government no danger flowing from speech can be deemed clear and present unless the incidence of the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion if there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies to avert the evil by the processes of education the remedy to be applied is more speech not enforced silence only an emergency can justify repression such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled with freedom such in my opinion is the command of the constitution it is therefore always open to americans to challenge a law abridging free speech and assembly by showing that there was no emergency justifying it comcore greatfire chicago in was a city ready to burn the city boasted havingbuildings many of them such as the courthouse and the tribune building large and ornately decorated the trouble was that about two thirds of all these structures were made entirely of wood many of the remaining buildings even the ones proclaimed to be fireproof looked solid but were actually jerry built affairs the stone or brick exteriors hid wooden frames and floors all topped with highly flammable tar or shingle roofs it was also a common practice to disguise wood as another kind of building material the fancy exterior decorations on just about every building were carved from wood then painted to look like stone or marble most churches had steeples that appeared to be solid from the street but a closer inspection would reveal a wooden framework covered with cleverly painted copper or tin the situation was worst in the middle class and poorer districts lot sizes were small and owners usually filled them up with cottages barns sheds and outhouses all made of fast burning wood naturally because both patrick and

lumberyards distilleries gasworks mills furniture manufacturers warehouses and coal distributors wealthier districts were by no means free of fire hazards stately stone and brick homes had wood interiors and stood side by side with smaller wood frame houses wooden stables and other storage buildings were common and trees lined the streets and filled the yards the links between richer and poorer sections went beyond the materials used for construction or the way buildings were crammed together chicago had been built largely on soggy marshland that flooded every time it rained as the years passed and the town developed a quick solution to the water and mud problem was needed the answer was to make the roads and sidewalks out of wood and elevate them above the waterline in some

to sit in the back of the bus even if there were empty seats up front back then racial segregation was the rule throughout the american south strict laws called jim crow laws enforced a system of white supremacy that discriminated against blacks and kept them in their place as second class citizens people were separated by race from the moment they were born in segregated hospitals until the day they were buried in segregated cemeteries blacks and whites did not attend the same schools worship in the same churches eat in the same restaurants sleep in the same hotels drink from the same water fountains or sit together in the same movie theaters in montgomery it was against the law for a white person and a negro to play checkers on public property or ride together in a taxi most southern blacks were denied their right to vote the biggest obstacle was the poll tax a special tax that was required of all voters but was too costly for many blacks and for poor whites as well voters also had to pass a literacy test to prove that they could read write and understand the u s constitution these tests were often rigged to disqualify even highly educated blacks those who overcame the obstacles and insisted on registering as voters faced threats harassment and even physical violence as a result african americans in the south could not express their grievances in the

at all he was left alone in the study time he was left alone in the play time he was always at the end of the line always at the foot of the class a forlorn little tag along soon chibi began to make his eyes cross eyed so that he was not able to see whatever he did not want to see and chibi found many ways one after another to kill time and amuse himself just the ceiling was interesting enough for him to watch for hours the wooden top of his desk was another interesting thing to watch a patch of cloth on a boys shoulder was something to study of course the window showed him many things all year round even when it was raining the window had surprising things to show him on the playground if he closed his eyes and listened chibi could hear many different sounds near and far and chibi could hold and watch insects and grubs that most of us wouldnt touch or even look it so that not only the children in our class but the older ones and even the younger ones called him stupid and

phosphorescent sea he marveled at the sight of some whales spouting luminous water and later lying on the deck of his boat gazing at the immense starry sky the tiny mouse amos a little speck of a living thing in the vast living universe felt thoroughly akin to it all overwhelmed by the beauty and mystery of everything he rolled over and over and right off the deck of his boat and into the sea

or should i just try to stay afloat he might swim a mile but never a thousand he decided to just keep afloat treading water and hoping that something who knows what would turn up to save him but what if a shark or some big fish a horse mackerel turned up what was he supposed to do to protect himself he didn t know morning came as it always does he was getting terribly tired he was a very small very cold very wet and worried mouse there was still nothing in sight but the empty sea then as if things weren t bad enough it began to rain at last the rain stopped and the noonday sun gave him a

coast of africa where he happened to be headed anyway to attend a meeting of whales from all the seven seas but amos said he d had enough adventure to last him a while he wanted only to get back home and hoped the whale wouldn t mind going out of his way to take him there not only would i not mind said boris i would consider it a privilege what other whale in the all the world ever had the chance to get to know such a strange creature as you please climb aboard and amos got on boris s back are you sure you re a mammal amos asked you smell more like a fish then boris the whale went swimming

and i d look for a treasure under the stove in the house of a fellow named isaac and he laughed again isaac bowed to the captain and started on his long way home he crossed over mountains he walked through forests now and then someone gave him a ride but most of the way he walked at last he reached his own town when he got home he dug under his stove and there he found the treasure in

trouble it kept slipping down the muddy bank the doe returned to the water to help but the more the fawn struggled the deeper it got stuck in the mud i pushed off the river bottom and drove the raft hard onto the muddy bank startling the doe then i dropped into the water i was ankle deep in mud you re okay i whispered to the fawn praying that the raft would calm it i won t hurt you gradually the

her mind wandered and she would think for hours on her childhood when she had friends and company why did pandora accept this lonely lighthouse life because a lighthouse had once saved her when

the long history of ships gone down and he carried little hope that help might come to them that someone might lead them away from the deadly shore for only a lighthouse might show them the way and

wise men who saw the bones tried to guess what sort of enormous animal they could have come from after they studied the fossil bones the ancient chinese decided that they came from dragons they thought these dragons must have been magic dragons to be so large and they believed that dragons could still be alive boy were they wrong no one knows exactly what dinosaurs looked like all that is left of them are fossil bones and a few other clues now that we think that many of our own past guesses about dinosaurs were just as wrong as those of ancient china some of our mistakes were little ones when the first fossil bones of iguanodon were found one was shaped like a rhino s horn scientists guessed that the strange horn fit like a spike on iguanodon s nose boy were we wrong about iguanodon when a full set of fossil bones was found later there were two pointed bones they were part of iguanodon s hands not its nose other new clues show us that we may have been wrong about every kind of dinosaur some of our first drawings of dinosaurs showed them with their elbows and knees pointing out to the side like a lizard s with legs like that big dinosaurs could only waddle clumsily on all fours or float underwater now we know that their legs were straight under them like a horse s dinosaurs were not clumsy the sizes and shapes of their leg bones see to show that some were as

beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations

whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it

face and a little thin body thin light hair and a sour expression her hair was yellow and her face was yellow because she had been born in india and had always been ill in one way or another her father had held a position under the english government and had always been busy and ill himself and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people she had not wanted a little girl at all and when mary was born she handed her over to the care of an ayah who was made to understand that if she wished to please the mem sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible so when she was a sickly fretful ugly little baby she was kept out of the way and when she became a sickly fretful toddling thing she was kept out of the way also she never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her ayah and the other native servants and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything because the mem

to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one so if mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all one frightfully hot morning when she was about nine years old she awakened feeling very cross and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her ayah why did you come she said to the strange woman i will not let you stay send my ayah to me the woman looked frightened but she only stammered that the ayah could not come and when mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the ayah to come to missie sahib there was something mysterious in the air that morning nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing while those whom mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces but no one would tell her anything and her ayah did not come she was actually left alone as the morning went on and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda she pretended that she was making a flower bed and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of

hurricanesearthsmightieststorms great whirling storms roar out of the oceans in many parts of the world they are called by several names hurricane typhoon and cyclone are the three most familiar ones but no matter what they are called they are all the same sort of storm they are born in the same way in tropical waters they develop the same way feeding on warm moist air and they do the same kind of damage both ashore and at sea other storms may cover a bigger area or have higher winds but none can match both the size and the fury of hurricanes they are earth s mightiest storms like all storms they take place in the atmosphere the envelope of air that surrounds the earth and presses on its surface the pressure at any one place is always changing there are days when air is sinking and the atmosphere presses harder on the surface these are the times of high pressure there are days when a lot of air is rising and the atmosphere does not press down as hard these are times of low pressure low pressure areas over warm oceans give birth to hurricanes no one knows exactly what happens to start these storms but when conditions are right warm moist air is set in motion it begins to rise rapidly from the surface of the ocean in a low pressure area like water in a hose air flows from where there is more pressure to where there is less pressure and so air over the surface of the ocean flows into the low pressure area picking up moisture as it travels this warm moist air soars upward as the air rises above the earth it cools the cooling causes moisture to condense into tiny droplets of water that form clouds as the moisture condenses it gives off heat heat is one kind of energy it is the energy that powers the storm the clouds are the source of the storm s rain the low pressure area acts like a chimney warm air is drawn in at the bottom rises in a column cools and spreads out as the air inside rises and more air is drawn in the storm grows the air being drawn in however does not travel in a straight line the earth s surface is rotating and the rotation causes the path to curve the air travels in a spiral within the storm in the northern hemisphere the spiraling winds travel counterclockwise the opposite of the way the hands of a clock move in the southern hemisphere they travel clockwise comcore kidsguidetomoney budgeting your spending spending your money on the

the earth these were used as tombs temples and chiefs houses some of the mounds were very large requiring the coordinated labor of many tribe members remember that this was a time well before the invention of any kind of vehicle let alone construction vehicles the mounds were built with literally basketloads of soil mounds were constructed by the peoples of several distinctive cultures whose existence spanned many centuries for example louisiana s poverty point culture of b c erected some of the oldest known mounds in the southeast another period of major mound building from b c to a d witnessed the construction of conical burial mounds throughout the southeast the last important mound building culture about known as mississippian lived in large towns along river floodplains and formed huge flat topped mounds aboutyears ago at a place in northeastern louisiana called poverty point a group of indians developed a complex society and trade center on the floodplain of the mississippi river these indians established long distance trading networks they sought steatite from georgia and alabama galena from missouri copper from the great lakes and diverse stones from alabama tennessee kentucky ohio indiana arkansas and mississippi these raw materials were made into cups bowls smoking pipes and beads and other ornaments to wear the poverty point indians were great craftsmen and engineers they created a collection of mounds whose outlines formed the shape of a giant bird it is a striking effigy parts of which still can be seen today the bird measures by feet and has outspread wings whose central mound stands feet tall it is connected to three smaller mounds and six concentric low ridges that were arranged in a crescent shape surrounding a curve of the mississippi river millions of cubic feet of earth more than two thirds of a mile long were moved to build the latter what purpose this construction served still is not clear today later mounds were used as tombs for the dead after the death of a very important member of the group such as a warrior elder or religious leader the person was placed in a pit or tomb made of logs sometimes the burial structure was burned and covered over with earth as additional significant people died they were put on top of the original mound slowly these mounds turned into hills of earth that sometimes joined other similar mounds at the height of the mississippian culture around the years hundreds of towns and smaller settlements covered the southeast but bymany of the great ceremonial centers including moundville were in a decline perhaps the large populations of these indian cultures depleted the soils and forests thus reducing their food and building supplies but there is quite a legacy from these diverse ancient people who engineered the enormous mounds we can still see today to honor their leaders and loved ones comcore abouttime sometime aroundthe spring powered clock was invented instead of depending on the pull of weights for power this type of clock used a flat metal spring wound tightly into a coil the escapement allowed the spring to unwind by turning one gear tooth at a time with the use of a spring smaller truly portable clocks could be made the first well known watches made in germany around by peter henlein were so named because guards or watchmen carried small clocks to keep track of how long to stay at a particular duty post many different skills went into making a clock and new tools and methods were constantly being invented to make ever smaller more complicated mechanisms that worked with greater precision founders melted and poured metal into a mold to make clock parts spring makers hand forged heated and pounded into shape and polished steel clock springs

and dance and sing of the fish and animals they will hunt they also sing of their ancestors and of their fears and hopes and they pray to the animals for forgiveness and for good luck in the hunt sometimes they have wrestling contests often they wrestle just for fun sometimes the best wrestler gets to marry a special girl many americans elsewhere in north america live in communities where almost everything is shared sometimes even leadership that is not true here these indians care about wealth property and prestige press teej it means importance and reputation they value private property and they pass their property on to their children and grandchildren they own slaves and sometimes go to war with other indians just to capture slaves people are not treated as equals in this society they are divided into ranks or classes there are slaves commoners and nobles in times of strife many of the men become warriors and wear wooden helmets and wood slat armor comcore mylibrarianisacamel children in peru can receive their book in several different innovative ways cedili ibby peru is an institution that delivers books in bags to families in lima each bag contains twenty books which families can keep for a month the books come in four different reading levels so that children really learn how to read this project in spanish is called el libro compartido en familia and enables parents to share the joy of books with their children in small rural communities books are delivered in wooden suitcases and plastic bags these suitcases and bags contain books that the community can keep and share for the next three months the number of book in each suitcase depends on the size of the community there are no library buildings in these small towns and people gather outside in the plaza to see books they can check out in the coastal regions books are sometimes delivered by donkey cart the books are stored in the reading promoter s home in the ancient city of cajamarca reading promoters from various rural areas select and receive a large collection of books for their area the program is called aspaderuc the reading promoter lends these books to his or her neighbors and after three months a new selection of books goes out to each area books in this system are for children and adults and last but not least fe y alegria brings a collection of children s books to rural schools the books are brought from school to school by wagon the children who are excited about browsing through the books when they arrive are turning into avid readers comcore horses horses move in four natural ways called gaits or paces they walk trot canter and gallop the walk is the slowest gait and the gallop is the fastest when a horse walks each hoof leaves the ground at a different time it moves one hind leg first and then the front leg on the same side then the other hind leg and the other front leg when a horse walks its body swings gently with each stride when a horse trots its legs move in pairs left front leg with right hind leg and right front leg when a horse canters the hind legs and one front leg move together and then the hind legs and the other foreleg move together the gallop is like a much faster walk where each hoof hits the ground one after another when a horse gallops all four of its hooves may be flying off the ground at the same time horses are usually described by their coat colors and by the white markings on their faces bodies legs and hooves brown horses range in color from dark brown bays and chestnuts to golden browns such as palominos and lighter browns such as roans and duns partly colored horses are called pintos or paints colorless pure white horses albinos are rare most horses that look white are actually gray

baby mammals one day it s big enough to poke its head out to see the world the european explorers who saw kangaroos for the first time in australia reported they had discovered a two headed animal with one head on the neck and another in the belly north america has only one marsupial you may have seen it the virginia opossum actually lives in most of the united states not just virginia south america also has marsupials but most marsupials live in or near australia they include the koala which is not a bear two species of wombat the toothy black tasmania devil four species of black and white spotted native cats though they re not cats at all and many others the most famous marsupials however are the kangaroos all kangaroos hop some of them six feet high and faster than forty miles

why they spouted red hot molten rock in modern times scientists began to study volcanoes they still don t know all the answers but they know much about how a volcano works our planet made up of many layers of rock the top layers of solid rock are called the crust deep beneath the crust is the mantle where it is so hot that some rock melts the melted or molten rock is called magma volcanoes are

world around them and survive eyes can guide the falcon to dinner or help the mouse see a perfect place to hide animal eyes come in many different shapes sizes colors and even numbers yet they do the same job they all catch light with help from the brain eyes turn light into sight eyes work in the same way for people look at this page you may think you see words and pictures believe it or not you don t all you see is light bouncing off the page how is this possible the secret is in the rules of light light rules light is a form of energy like heat or sound it can come from a natural source like the sun or artificial sources like a lamp or a flashlight light is the fastest known thing it travels in waves and in nearly straight lines in air it can speedkilometers miles per second it can race from the sun to earth in just over eight minutes light doesn t always travel so fast for example water or glass can slow light down but just a bit light may seem to break all driving speed laws yet there are certain rules it always follows light reflects or bounces off objects it also refracts or bends and it can be absorbed or soaked up by objects these rules of light affect what and how we see light eyes imagine this scene you re at your desk happily reading explorer magazine light from your desk lamp scatters in all directions light hits the page some bounces off the page or reflects it changes direction it s a little like how sound bounces off a wall now some of this reflected light is traveling right toward your face don t duck for you to see explorer some of this light has to enter your eyes objects become visible when light bounces off them your eyes are light catchers yet it takes more than catching light to see an image your eyes also have to bend light here s how first light hits your cornea that s the clear covering on the front of your eyeball the cornea refracts or bends light and action is your cornea super strong no think about how light travels more slowly through water the same thing happens in your cornea as light passes through the cornea it slows down that makes the light change direction or bend next light enters your pupil the dark center part of your eye it passes through your lens the lens bends light too what s the big deal about bending light that s how your eyes focus or aim the light to make a clear image the image appears on your retina at the back of your eyeball it s like a movie playing today at a theater in your eye explorer magazine there s only one problem the image is upside down luckily your brain flips the image right side up that s pretty smart comcore computer the word computer once meant a person who did computations but now it almost always refers to automated electronic devices computers can do much more than calculate however they are now used in all sorts of ways to better control or automate products and processes for example computers are used in airplanes and automobiles to control the way that fuel is injected into the engine and they are used to monitor every part of the production process in most modern factories computers help people write reports draw pictures and keep track of information since the invention of the internet computers are also used to gather information from digital libraries located all over the world to send and receive electronic messages e mail and to work shop and bank from home computers come in many sizes and shapes they range from small devices that perform one specific function such as those in cameras that control the shutter speed to supercomputers supercomputers are specially engineered to be able to perform trillions of operations per second because they are so powerful and therefore so expensive they are generally used only by government agencies and large research centers parts of a computer system a computer system requires both hardware and software hardware includes all of the mechanical parts of a computer software consists of the instructions and data that the hardware uses to perform its tasks hardware all computers no matter how large or small have basically the same types of hardware these include a central processing unit cpu memory storage secondary memory input output i o devices and some type of telecommunication device the cpu is the computer s brain where all computations are performed the computer carries out its computations one step at a time with each step occurring on each beat of its built in clock the fastest computer clocks now beat more than ghz gigahertz or billions of times per second memory is where instructions and data are held while being worked on read only memory rom is built into the computer and cannot be changed rom contains instructions that the computer needs to start up random access memory ram or one of its variants is typically used for the main computer memory because of its speed information is stored temporarily in ram as a computer processes data and instructions secondary memory is where instructions and data are saved for long term storage most computers use a magnetic device called a hard drive for storage a hard drive accesses data very quickly slower devices are often used to store files on magnetic tape or optical discs such as compact discs cds and digital video discs dvds i o devices enable communication between a computer and the person using it input devices allow the user to enter data or commands for processing by the cpu they include the keyboard mouse joystick scanner and digital tablet output devices let the user see or hear the results of the computer s data processing they include the monitor printer and speakers telecommunication devices enable computers to send data through telephone lines or other channels in this way computer users can exchange information with one another these devices include regular telephone modems digital subscriber line dsl telephone modems cable modems and various wireless modems comcore telescopes you can see planets stars and other objects in space just by looking up on a clear night but to really see them to observe the craters on the moon the rings around saturn and the countless other wonders in our sky you must use a telescope a telescope is an instrument used to produce magnified enlarged images of distant objects it does this by gathering and focusing the light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected by those objects the word telescope comes from two greek words meaning far and see kinds of telescopes there are many different types of telescopes both optical and non optical optical telescopes are designed to focus visible light non optical telescopes are designed to detect kinds of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the human eye these include radio waves infrared radiation x rays ultraviolet radiation and gamma rays the word optical means making use of light some telescopes are launched into space these telescopes gain clearer views and they can collect forms of electromagnetic radiation that are absorbed by the earth s atmosphere and do not reach the ground optical telescopes different types of optical telescopes gather and focus light in different ways refracting telescopes or refractors use lenses reflecting telescopes or reflectors use mirrors and catadioptric telescopes or catadioptrics use a combination of lenses and mirrors the main lens or mirror in an optical telescope is called the objective refracting telescopes a refracting telescope is typically a long tube shaped instrument the objective is a system of lenses at the front end of the tube the end facing the sky when light strikes the lenses it is bent and brought to a focus within the tube this forms an image of a distant object this image can be magnified by the eyepiece this consists of a group of small lenses at the back of the tube a camera can replace or be added to the eyepiece then photographs can be taken of celestial objects for many years these cameras used film today most are equipped with charge coupled devices ccd s these devices use semiconductor chips to electronically capture images ccd s are similar to the devices in home digital cameras and video camcorders however the ccd s used by astronomers are usually extremely sensitive to light comcore undergroundrailroad the underground railroad

nearly an hour and for a minute no one spoke only a minute for jo exclaimed impetuously i m so glad you came before we began may i go and help carry the things to the poor little children asked beth

procession set out fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no

never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born that was a very happy breakfast though they didn t get any of it and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning that s loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for

along on all sorts of delicious expeditions and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work the very thought of it burnt him like fire he got out his worldly wealth and examined it bits of toys marbles and trash enough to buy an exchange of work maybe but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom so he returned his straitened means to his pocket and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys at this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him nothing less than a great magnificent inspiration he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work ben

eating an apple and giving a long melodious whoop at intervals followed by a deep toned ding dong dong ding dong dong for he was personating a steamboat as he drew near he slackened speed took the middle of the street leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance for he was personating the big missouri and considered himself to be drawing nine

eye of an artist then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result as before ben ranged up alongside of him tom s mouth watered for the apple but he stuck to his work ben said hello old chap you got to work hey tom wheeled suddenly and said why it s you ben i warn t noticing say i m going in a swimming i am don t you wish you could but of course you d druther work wouldn t you course you would tom contemplated the boy a bit and said what do you call work why ain t that work tom resumed his whitewashing and answered carelessly well maybe it is and maybe it ain t all i know is it suits tom sawyer oh come now you don t mean to let on that you like it the brush continued to move like it well i don t see why i oughtn t to like it does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day that put the thing in a new light ben stopped nibbling his apple tom swept his brush daintily back and forth stepped back to note the effect added a touch here and there criticised the effect again ben watching every move and getting more and more interested more and more absorbed presently he said say tom let me whitewash a little tom considered was about to consent but he altered his mind no no i reckon it wouldn t hardly do ben you see aunt polly s awful particular about this fence right here on the street you know but if it was the back fence i wouldn t mind and she wouldn t yes she s awful particular about this fence it s got to be done very careful i reckon there ain t one boy in a thousand maybe two thousand that can do it the way it s got to be done no is that so oh come now lemme just try only just a little i d let you if you was me tom ben i d like to honest injun but aunt polly well jim wanted to do it but she wouldn t let him sid wanted to do it and she wouldn t let sid now don t you see how i m fixed if you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it oh shucks i ll be just as careful now lemme try say i ll give you the core of my apple well here no ben now don t i m afeard i ll give you all of it tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his heart and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in the sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by dangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of more innocents there was no lack of material boys happened along every little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash by the time ben was fagged out tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for a kite in good repair and when he played out johnny miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with and so on and so on hour after hour and when the middle of the afternoon came from being a poor poverty stricken boy in the morning tom was literally rolling in wealth he had besides the things before mentioned twelve marbles part of a jews harp a piece of blue bottle glass to look through a spool cannon a key that wouldn t unlock anything a fragment of chalk a glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles six fire crackers a kitten with only one eye a brass doorknob a dog collar but no dog the handle of a

out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all he had discovered a great law of human action without knowing it namely that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain if he had been a great and wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do and this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread mill is work while rolling ten pins or climbing mont blanc is only amusement there are wealthy gentlemen in england who drive four horse passenger coaches

woken by music it beckoned him lilting and insistent delicate music played by delicate instruments that he could not identify with one rippling bell like phrase running through it in a gold thread of delight there was in this music so much of the deepest enchantment of all his dreams and imaginings that he woke smiling in pure happiness at the sound in the moment of his waking it began to fade beckoning as it went and then as he opened his eyes it was gone he had only the memory of that one rippling phrase still echoing in his head and itself fading so fast that he sat up abruptly in bed and reached his arm out to the air as if he could bring it back the room was very still and there was no music and yet will knew that it had not been a dream he was in the twins room still he could hear robin s breathing slow and deep from the other bed cold light glimmered round the edge of the curtains but no one was stirring anywhere it was very early will pulled on his rumpled clothes from the day before and slipped out of the room he crossed the landing to the central window and looked down in the first shining moment he saw the whole strange familial world glistening white the roofs of the outbuildings mounded into square towers of snow and beyond them all the fields and hedge buried merged into one great flat expanse unbroken white to the horizon s brim will drew in a long happy breath silently rejoicing then very faintly he heard the music again the same phrase he swung round vainly searching for it in the air as if he might see it somewhere like a flickering light where are

not piled now on roofs or stretching flat over lawns and fields there were no roofs there were no fields there were only trees will was looking over a great white forest a forest of massive trees sturdy as towers and ancient as rock they were bare of leaves clad only in the deep snow that lay untouched along every branch each smallest twig they were everywhere they began so close to the house that he was looking out through the topmost branches of the nearest tree could have reached out and shaken them if he had dared to open the window all around him the trees stretched to the flat horizon of the valley the only break in that white world of branches was away over to the south where the thames ran he could see the bend in the river marked like a single stilled wave in this white ocean of forest and the shape of it looked as though the river were wider than it should have been will gazed and gazed and when at last he stirred he found that he was clutching the smooth iron circle threaded onto his belt the iron was warm to his touch he went back into the bedroom robin he said loudly wake up but robin breathed slowly and rhythmically as before and did not stir he ran into the bedroom next door the familiar small room that he had once shared with james and shook james roughly by the shoulder but when the shaking was done james lay motionless deeply asleep will went out onto the landing again and took a long breath and he shouted with all his might wake up wake up everyone he did not now expect any response and none came there was a total silence as deep and timeless as the blanketing snow the house and everyone in it lay in a sleep that would not be broken will went downstairs to pull on his boots and the old sheepskin jacket that had belonged before him to two or three of his brothers in turn then he went out of the back door closing it quietly behind him and stood looking out through the quick white vapour of his breath the strange white world lay stroked by silence no birds sang the garden was no longer there in this forested land nor were the outbuildings nor the old crumbling walls there lay only a narrow clearing round the house now hummocked with unbroken snowdrifts before the trees began with a narrow path leading away will set out down the white tunnel of the path slowly stepping high to keep the snow out of his boots as soon as he moved away from the house he felt very much alone and he made himself go on without looking back over his shoulder because he knew that when he looked he would find that the house was gone he accepted everything that came into his mind without thought or question as if he were moving through a dream but a deeper part of him knew that he was not dreaming he was crystal clear awake in a midwinter day that had been waiting for him to wake into it since the day he had been born and he somehow knew for centuries before that tomorrow will be beyond imagining will came out of the white

the fire casts on the wall in front of them how could they if they have to keep their heads motionless throughout life what about the things being carried along the wall isn t the same true of them of course and if they could talk to one another don t you think they d suppose that the names they used applied to the things they see passing before them they d have to and what if their prison also had an echo from the wall facing them don t you think they d believe that the shadows passing in front of them were talking whenever one of the carriers passing along the wall was doing so i certainly do then the prisoners would in every way believe that the truth is nothing other than the shadows of those artifacts they must surely believe that consider then what being released from their bonds and cured of their ignorance would naturally be like if something like this came to pass when one of them was freed and suddenly compelled to stand up turn his head walk and look up toward the light he d be pained and dazzled and unable to see the things whose shadows he d seen before what do you think he d say if we told him that what he d seen before was inconsequential but that now because he is a bit closer to the things that are and is turned towards things that are more he sees correctly or to put it another way if we pointed to each of the things passing by asked him what each of them is and compelled him to answer don t you think he d be at a loss and that he d believe the things he saw earlier were truer than the ones he was now being shown much truer and if someone compelled him to look at the light itself wouldn t his eyes hurt and wouldn t he turn around and flee towards the things he s able to see believing that they re really clearer than the ones he s being shown he would and if someone dragged him away from there by force up the rough steep path and didn t let him go until he had dragged him into the sunlight wouldn t he be pained and irritated at being treated that way and when he came into the light with the sun filling his eyes wouldn t he be unable to see a single one of the things now said to be true he would be unable to see them at least at first i suppose then that he d need time to get adjusted before he could see things in the world above at first he d see shadows most easily then images of men and other things in water then the things themselves of these he d be able to study the things in the sky and the sky itself more easily at night looking at the light of the stars and the moon than during the day looking at the sun and the light of the moon of course finally i suppose he d be able to see the sun not images of it in water or some alien place but the sun itself in its own place and be able to study it necessarily so and at this point he would infer and conclude that the sun provides the seasons and the years governs everything in the visible world and is in some way the cause of all the things that he used to see it s clear that would be his next step what about when he reminds himself of his first dwelling place his fellow prisoners and what passed for wisdom there don t you think that he d count himself happy for the change and pity the others certainly and if there had been any honors praises or prizes among them for the one who was sharpest at identifying the shadows as they passed by and who best remembered which usually came earlier which later and which simultaneously and who could thus best divine the future do you think that our man would desire these rewards or envy those among the prisoners who were honored and held power instead wouldn t he feel with homer that he d much prefer to work the earth as a serf to another one without possessions and go through any sufferings rather than share their opinions and live as they do i suppose he would rather suffer anything than live like that consider this too if this man went down into the cave again and sat down in his same seat wouldn t his eyes coming suddenly out of the sun like that be filled with darkness they certainly would comcore gettysburgaddress fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battlefield of that war we are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting place of those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this but in a large sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth comcore leesurrenderstogrant when lee came to the sentence about the officers side arms private horses baggage he showed for the first time during the reading of the letter a slight change of countenance was evidently touched by this act of generosity it was doubtless the condition mentioned to which he particularly alluded when he looked toward general grant as he finished reading said with some degree of warmth in his manner this will have a very happy effect upon my army general grant then said unless you have some suggestions to make in regard to the form in which i have stated the terms i will have a copy of the letter made in ink and sign it there is one thing i should like to mention lee replied after a short pause the cavalrymen and artillerists own their own horses in our army its organization in this respect differs from that of the united states this expression attracted the notice of our officers present as showing how firmly the conviction was grounded in his mind that we were two distinct countries he continued i should like to understand whether these men will be permitted to retain their horses you will find that the terms as written do not allow this general grant replied only the officers are permitted to take their private property lee read over the second page of the letter again and then said no i see the terms do not allow it that is clear his face showed plainly that he was quite anxious to have this concession made and grant said very promptly and without giving lee time to make a direct request well the subject is quite new to me of course i did not know that any private soldiers owned their animals but i think we have fought the last battle of the war i sincerely hope so and that the surrender of this army will be followed soon by that of all the others and i take it that most of the men in the ranks are small farmers and as the country has been so raided by the two armies it is doubtful whether they will be able to put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the next winter without the aid of the horses they are now riding and i will arrange it in this way i will not change the terms as now written but i will instruct the officers i shall appoint to receive the paroles to let all the men who claim to own a horse or mule take the animals home with them to work their little farms comcore addresstothenation good evening my fellow citizens this afternoon following a series of threats and defiant statements the presence of alabama national guardsmen was required on the university of alabama to carry out the final and unequivocal order of the united states district court of the northern district of alabama that order called for the admission of two clearly qualified young alabama residents who happened to have been born negro that they were admitted peacefully on the campus is due in good measure to the conduct of the students of the university of alabama who met their responsibilities in a constructive way i hope that every american regardless of where he lives will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incidents this nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds it was founded on the principle that all men are created equal and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free and when americans are sent to vietnam or west berlin we do not ask for whites only it ought to be possible therefore for american students of any color to attend any public institution they select without having to be backed up by troops it ought to be possible for american consumers of any color to receive equal service in places of public accommodation such as hotels and restaurants and theaters and retail stores without being forced to resort to demonstrations in the street and it ought to be possible for american citizens of any color to register and to vote in a free election without interference or fear of reprisal it ought to be possible in short for every american to enjoy the privileges of being american without regard to his race or his color in short every american ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated as one would wish his children to be treated but this is not the case the negro baby born in america today regardless of the section of the state in which he is born has about one half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same day one third as much chance of completing college one third as much chance of becoming a professional man twice as much chance of becoming unemployed about one seventh as much chance of earning a year a life expectancy which is years shorter and the prospects of earning only half as much this is not a sectional issue difficulties over segregation and discrimination exist in every city in every state of the union producing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threatens the public safety nor is this a partisan issue in a time of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics this is not even a legal or legislative issue alone it is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets and new laws are needed at every level but law alone cannot make men see right we are confronted primarily with a moral issue it is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the american constitution the heart of the question is whether all americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities whether we are going to treat our fellow americans as we want to be treated if an american because his skin is dark cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public if he cannot send his children to the best public school available if he cannot vote for the public officials who will represent him if in short he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay one hundred years of delay have passed since president lincoln freed the slaves yet their heirs their grandsons are not fully free they are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice they are not yet freed from social and economic oppression and this nation for all its hopes and all its boasts will not be fully free until all its citizens are free we preach freedom around the world and we mean it and we cherish our freedom here at home but are we to say to the world and much more importantly to each other that this is the land of the free except for the negroes that we have no second class citizens except negroes that we have no class or caste system no ghettoes no master race except with respect to negroes now the time has come for this nation to fulfill its promise the events in birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them the fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city north and south where legal remedies are not at hand redress is sought in the streets in demonstrations parades and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and threaten lives we face therefore a moral crisis as a country and a people it cannot be met by repressive police action it cannot be left to increased demonstrations in the streets it cannot be quieted by token moves or talk it is a time to act in the congress in your state and local legislative body and above all in all of our daily lives it is not enough to pin the blame on others to say this a problem of one section of the country or another or deplore the facts that we face a great change is at hand and our task our obligation is to make that revolution that change peaceful and constructive for all those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality this is one country it has become one country because all of us and all the people who came here had an equal chance to develop their talents we cannot say to ten percent of the population that you can t have that right that your children cannot have the chance to develop whatever talents they have that the only way that they are going to get their rights is to go in the street and demonstrate i think we owe them and we owe ourselves a better country than that therefore i m asking for your help in making it easier for us to move ahead and to provide the kind of equality of treatment which we would want ourselves to give a chance for every child to be educated to the limit of his talents as i ve said before not every child has an equal talent or an equal ability or equal motivation but they should have the equal right to develop their talent and their ability and their motivation to make something of themselves we have a right to expect that the negro community will be responsible will uphold the law but they have a right to expect that the law will be fair that the constitution will be color blind as justice harlan said at the turn of the century this is what we re talking about and this is a matter which concerns this country and what it stands for and in meeting it i ask

renowned scientist scholar and founding father of this university mikhail lomonosov knew that it is common knowledge he said that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by the freedom of philosophy the explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs men with vision with the courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the unknown these entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the united states they are the prime movers of the technological revolution in fact one of the largest personal computer firms in the united states was started by two college students no older than you in the garage behind their home some people even in my own country look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste what of all the entrepreneurs that fail well many do particularly the successful ones often several times and if you ask them the secret of their success they ll tell you it s all that they learned in their struggles along the way yes it s what they learned from failing like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth experience is the greatest teacher we americans make no secret of our belief in freedom in fact it s something of a national pastime every years the american people choose a new president and is one of those years at one point there were major candidates running in the two major parties not to mention all the others including the socialist and libertarian candidates all trying to get

interviews and bring them together for debates in the end the people vote they decide who will be the next president but freedom doesn t begin or end with elections go to any american town to take just an example and you ll see dozens of churches representing many different beliefs in many places synagogues and mosques and you ll see families of every conceivable nationality worshiping together go into any schoolroom and there you will see children being taught the declaration of independence that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that no government can justly deny the guarantees in their constitution for freedom of speech freedom of assembly and freedom of religion go into any courtroom and there will preside an independent judge beholden to no government power there every defendant has the right to a trial by a jury of his peers usually men and women common citizens they are the ones the only ones who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence in that court the accused is innocent until proven guilty and the word of a policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the word of the accused go to any university campus and there you ll find an open sometimes heated discussion of the problems in american society and what can be done to correct them turn on the television and you ll see the legislature conducting the business of government right there before the camera debating and voting on the legislation that will become the law of the land march in any demonstration and there are many of them the people s right of assembly is guaranteed in the constitution and protected by the police go into any union hall where the members know their right to strike is protected by law but freedom is more even than this freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things it is the continuing revolution of the marketplace it is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions it is the right to put forth an idea scoffed at by the experts and watch it catch fire among the people it is the right to dream to follow your dream or stick to your conscience even if you re the only one in a sea of doubters freedom is the recognition that no single person no single authority or government has a

bitterly cold there was no moon but the cloudless sky blazed with starts the atlantic was like polished plate glass people later said they had never seen it so smooth this was the fifth night of the titanic s maiden voyage to new york and it was already clear that she was not only the largest but also the most glamorous ship in the world even the passengers dogs were glamorous john jacob astor

mostly just silence as the two men stared into the darkness now the watch was almost over and still there was nothing unusual just the night the stars the biting cold the wind that whistled through

shortwalk at giza a few miles north of saqqara sit three great pyramids each named for the king or pharaoh during whose reign it was built no other buildings are so well known yet the first sight of them sitting in their field is breathtaking when you walk among them you walk in a place made for giants they seem too large to have been made by human beings too perfect to have been formed by nature and when the sun is overhead not solid enough to be attached to the sand in the minutes before sunrise they are the color of faded roses and when the last rays of the desert sun touch them they turn to amber but whatever the light their broad proportions the beauty of the limestone and the care with which it is fitted into place create three unforgettable works of art what do we learn about art when we look at the pyramids first when all of the things that go into a work its components complement one another they create and object that has a certain spirit and we can call that spirit harmony the pyramids are harmonious because limestone a warm quiet material is a cordial companion for a simple logical pleasing shape in fact the stone and the shape are so comfortable with each other that the pyramids seem inevitable as though they were bound to have the form color and texture that they do have the pyramids also show us that simple things must be made with care the fine workmanship that went into the building of the pyramids is part of their beauty complicated shapes may conceal poor work such shapes distract our eye but in something as simple as a pyramid there is no way to hide its flaws because any flaw would mar its beauty the craftsmanship must be perfect finally pyramids show us that light helps to shape our feelings about art as the sun moves above the desert the pyramids seem to change as they do our feelings about them also change in the early morning they sit squarely on the horizon and we feel that they have become the kings for which they were named by midday they have become restless and change into silver white clouds and at dusk they settle down and regain their power the pyramids will always work their magic on us their forms so simple and

march the handsome soberly dressed reverend theodorus van gogh entered the ancient town hall of groot zundert in the brabant a province of the netherlands he opened the birth register to number twenty nine where exactly one year earlier he had sadly written vincent willem van gogh stillborn beside the inscription he wrote again vincent willem van gogh the name of his new healthy son who was sleeping soundly next to his mother in the tiny parsonage across the square the baby s arrival was an answered prayer for the still grieving family the first vincent lay buried in a tiny grave by the door of the church where pastor van gogh preached the vincent who lived grew to be a sturdy redheaded boy every sunday on his way to church young vincent would pass the headstone carved with the name he shared did he feel as if his dead brother where the rightful vincent the one who would remain perfect in his parents hearts and that he was merely an unsatisfactory replacement that might have been one of the reasons he spent so much of his life feeling like a lonely outsider as if he didn t fit anywhere in the world despite his dramatic beginning vincent had an ordinary childhood giving no hint of the painter he would become the small parsonage with an upstairs just two windows wide under a slanting roof quickly grew crowded by the time he was six he had two sisters anna and elizabeth and one brother theo whose gentle nature made him their mother s favorite their mother anna carbentus van gogh herself one of eight came from an artistic background her father had been a bookbinder to the royal family a gifted amateur artist who filled notebooks with drawings of plants and flowers she thought vincent had a pleasant talent that might be useful someday she didn t suspect he would develop into a great artist in fact she recalled only that once he modeled an elephant out of clay but smashed it when she and his father praised it more than he thought they should for the same reason he tore up a drawing of a cat climbing a tree it wasn t his artistic ability but his obstinate personality that left the biggest impression on his mother that willful stubbornness turned up again and again as he grew older with a big family and a little house the children spent a lot of time out of doors the freckled red haired vincent solitary by nature often wandered by himself in fields and heaths that surrounded the parsonage he became familiar with the seasons of planting and harvest and with the hardworking local farm families whose labors connected them to the soil the strong feeling he developed for the rural landscape of brabant and the lives of its peasants would be one of the major influences in his life mostly he did what boys like to do he collected bugs and birds nests he teased his sisters he built sand castles in the garden with theo sometimes he invented games for all of them to play after one exciting day his brothers and sisters thanked vincent by staging a ceremony and with mock formality presented him with a rosebush from their father s garden comcore thisland i hate a song that makes you think that you re not any good i hate a song that makes you

there the next he d be gone vanishing without a word to anyone abandoning those he loved best he d throw on a few extra shirts one on top of the other sling his guitar over his shoulder and hit the road he d stick out his thumb and hitchhike swing onto moving freight trains and hunker down with other traveling men in flophouses hobo jungles and hoovervilles across depression america he moved restlessly from state to state soaking up some songs work songs mountain and cowboy songs sea chanteys songs from the southern chain gangs he added them to the dozens he already knew from his childhood until he was bursting with american folk songs playing the guitar and singing he started making up new ones hard bitten rough edged songs that told it like it was full of anger and hardship and hope and love woody said the best songs came to him when he was walking down a road he always had fifteen or twenty songs running around in his mind just waiting to be put together sometimes he knew the words but not the melody usually he d borrow a tune that was already well known the simpler the better as he walked along he tried to catch a good easy song that people could sing the first time they heard it remember and sing again later woody sang his songs the old fashioned way his voice droning and nasal the words sharp and clear promoters and club owners wanted him to follow their tightly written scripts and sing the melodious popular songs that were on the radio whenever they came at him with their hands full of cash woody ran the other way i had rather sound like the cab

time he stopped in a diner he heard irving berlin s lush sentimental song god bless america on the jukebox it was exactly the kind of song woody couldn t stand romanticizing america telling people not to worry that god would take care of everything woody thought there was plenty to worry about the great depression which had begun inwas grinding on for years desperate hungry people had been tramping the roads and riding the rails looking for work or handouts in europe another world war was raging threatening to pull america into the bloody conflict bits of tunes and snatches of words swirled in

his neat script all you can write is what you see and put the song away writing about what he saw and felt and heard about and read about gave woody plenty of material during his lifetime he wrote

highway in april woody recorded this land is your land when his good friend pete seeger heard the recording he thought the song was one of woody s weaker attempts too simple thought pete an accomplished folk singer himself later he would say that shows how wrong you can be over the years he watched as this land is your land went from one guitar picker to another gathering momentum as it made its way across america and out into the world after woody s death inthe song kept steadily spreading today this land is your land is sung all over the united states by just about everybody

flying buttresses were installed they would support the arched stone ribs until the mortar was dry at which times the ribs could support themselves the ribs carried the webbing which was the ceiling itself the vaults were constructed one bay at a time a bay being the rectangular area between four piers one by one the cut stones of the ribs called voussoirs were hoisted onto the centering and mortared into place by the masons finally the keystone was lowered into place to lock the ribs together at the crown the highest point of the arch the carpenters then installed pieces of wood called lagging that spanned the space between two centerings on top of the lagging the masons laid one course or layer of webbing stones the lagging supported the course of webbing until the mortar was dry two teams each with a mason and a carpenter worked simultaneously from both sides of the vault installing first the lagging then the webbing when they met in the center the vault was complete the vaulting over the aisle was constructed in the same way and at the same time when the mortar in the webbing had set a four inch layer of concrete was poured over the entire vault to prevent any cracking between the stones once the concrete had set the lagging was removed and the centering was lowered and moved onto the scaffolding of the next bay the procedure was repeated until eventually

solid mass as hard as stone on some projects small amounts are mixed right on the spot it can be formed or cast into almost any shape the aggregate sand and crushed stone or gravel is added to the mixture to give more volume portland cement is a combination of limestone and clay ground to very fine powder and heated in a kiln to drive out the moisture chemicals and other materials can be added to give special properties to the concrete for waterproofing for insulation to make a lighter more porous concrete or to affect the drying time the ingredients in concrete are proportioned for specific uses in the foundation of a skyscraper there is more sand and stone in the mix than cement in the upper structure of the building more cement is used and less aggregate since this allows the support columns and other parts of the building to be thinner or reduced in bulk without losing strength the amount of water in the mix is also carefully controlled just enough to ensure maximum

practical steel reinforcing bars some are inches in diameter and weigh pounds per foot are embedded in the concrete when tied in clusters or woven into a mesh of wires and bars the steel bars give the hardened concrete the strength to withstand any vertical stress and strain as well as horizontal pressure the protruding ends of the steel bars seen at all concrete construction sites are for the connection of this reinforcement by which a freshly formed concrete section is solidly bonded to the metal reinforcing of the rest of the concrete building the bars must be placed in the areas of maximum tensile stress as determined by the engineers comcore numberdevil i see said the number devil with a wry smile i have nothing against your mr bockel but that kind of problem has nothing

each side measuring centimeters remember each angle of an equilateral triangle measures divide each centimeter side into three parts each measuring three centimeters at the middle of each side add an equilateral triangle one third the size of the original facing outward because each side of the original triangle is centimeters the new triangles will have centimeter sides when you examine the outer edge of your diagram you should se a six pointed star made up of line segments at the middle of each segment of the star add a triangle one ninth the side of the original triangle the new triangles will have sides centimeter in length so divide each centimeter segment into thirds and use the middle third to form a new triangle going one step farther you create a shape that begins to resemble a

best mousetrap for that would preclude the inventor himself from coming up with a still better mousetrap without suffering the embarrassment of having previously declared the search complete as with

processes and its history mountains valleys plains sea floors minerals rocks fossils and the processes that create and destroy each of these are all the domain of the geologist geology is divided into two broad categories of study physical geology and historical geology physical geology is concerned with the processes occurring on or below the surface of earth and the materials on which they operate these processes include volcanic eruptions landslides earthquakes and floods materials include rocks air seawater soils and sediment physical geology further divides into more specific branches each of which deals with its own part of earth s materials landforms and processes mineralogy and petrology investigate the composition and origin of minerals and rocks volcanologists study lava rocks and gases on live dormant and extinct volcanoes seismologists use instruments to monitor and predict earthquakes and volcanic eruptions historical geology is concerned with the chronology of events both physical and biological that have taken place in earth s history paleontologists study fossils remains of ancient life for evidence of the evolution of life on earth fossils not only relate evolution but also speak of the environment in which the organism lived corals in rocks at the top of the grand canyon in arizona for example show a shallow sea flooded the area around million years ago in addition by determining the ages and types of rocks around the world geologists piece together continental and oceanic history over the past few billion years plate tectonics the study of the movement of the sections of earth s crust adds to earth s story with details of the changing configuration of the continents and oceans comcore spaceprobe a space probe is an unpiloted spacecraft that leaves earth s orbit to explore the moon planets asteroids comets or other objects in outer space as directed by onboard computers and or instructions send from earth the purpose of such missions is to make scientific observations such as taking pictures measuring atmospheric conditions and collecting soil samples and to bring or report the data back to earth numerous space probes have been launched since the former soviet union first fired luna toward the moon in probes have now visited each of the eight planets in the solar system in fact two probes voyager and voyager are approaching the edge of the solar system for their eventual trip into the interstellar medium by january voyager was about billion miles billion kilometers from the sun and in may it entered the heliosheath the boundary where the solar wind is thought to end which is the area that roughly divides the solar system from interstellar space voyager is not quite as far as its sister probe voyager is expected to be the first human space probe to leave the solar system both voyager probes are still transmitting signals back to earth they are expected to help gather further information as to the true boundary of the solar system the earliest probes traveled to the closest extraterrestrial target the moon the former soviet union launched a series of luna probes that provided humans with first pictures of the far side of the moon inluna made the first successful landing on the moon and sent back television footage from the moon s surface the national aeronautics and space administration nasa initially made several unsuccessful attempts to send a probe to the moon not until did a ranger probe reach its mark and send back thousands of pictures then a few months after lunanasa landed surveyor on the moon in the meantime nasa was moving ahead with the first series of planetary probes called mariner mariner first reached the planet venus in later mariner spacecrafts flew by mars in andproviding detailed images of that planet inmariner became the first spacecraft to orbit mars during its year in orbit mariner s two television cameras transmitted footage of an intense martian dust storm as well as images of percent of the planet s surface and the two martian natural satellites moons encounters were also made with mars in by the u s probes viking and viking each viking spacecraft consisted of both an orbiter and a lander viking made the first successful soft landing on mars on july soon after viking landed on the opposite side of the planet the viking orbiters made reports on the martian weather and photographed almost the entire surface of the planet comcore elementaryparticles since ancient times people have tried to discover the basic units of matter what they have asked are the smallest particles from which all the objects in the universe are made many people in ancient greece thought that all matter was made of various combinations of four basic elements earth fire air and water but one greek philosopher democritus c dc b c had a different theory he suggested that matter was composed of tiny particles called atoms the word atom comes from a greek word meaning unable to be cut or indivisible the theory of democritus was largely ignored foryears then inan english chemist and physicist named john dalton d revived the atomic theory he was the first scientist to define the atom as it is understood today the smallest particle of an element that behaves chemically like that element atomic physics is the study of atoms and their behavior atoms are incredibly small a tiny speck of dust contains many millions of atoms some molecules such as certain of the protein molecules contain hundreds of thousands of atoms yet a protein molecule is so small compared with things we can see with the unaided eye that a powerful electron microscope is needed to view it even then the individual atoms cannot usually be seen small as the atom is however it is not the smallest component of matter particle physics is the study of the smallest most elemental building blocks and the basic forces of nature inside the atom beginning in the late s scientists discovered that the atom is composed of still smaller particles the first of these subatomic particles to be discovered was the electron then it was found that the atom has a central core which was named the nucleus surrounding the nucleus are the electrons the nucleus of the simplest atom that of ordinary hydrogen consists of a single particle the proton a single electron moves around the nucleus a heavier nucleus such as that of an oxygen or an iron atom contains two kinds of particles protons and neutrons neutrons are about the same size as protons electrons are much smaller than protons and neutrons by the s the basic structure of matter seemed almost completely understood scientists had established that electrons protons and neutrons are the chief components of an atom but since that time several hundred other particles have been discovered in some cases the existence of these particles was predicted on the basis of complicated theories the particles themselves were later detected during experiments in other cases the particles were discovered first physicists presented new theories to try to make sense out of the chaos of particles that had been detected one theory gained favor it states that particles such as protons and neutrons are not elementary at all but are themselves made up of even smaller units called quarks this theory has revolutionized the picture of the elementary particles many physicists now think that quarks and a second group of particles the leptons which include electrons are the fundamental building blocks of nature yet quarks never appear alone only in groups of two or three forming composite particles understanding why is one of many challenges in the field of particle physics some recent theories and discoveries are described in greater detail in the article particle physics this article focuses mainly on the properties of subatomic particles and the principles that seem to govern their behavior particles of subatomic size can be observed only indirectly because they are too minute and move far too rapidly to be seen but physicists can determine how particles interact and how they are affected by electrical and magnetic forces scientists can detect new particles that form as existing particles decay or react with each other in this way they have learned a great deal about the nature of various particles comcore odyssey sing to me of the man muse the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course once he had plundered the hallowed heights of troy many cities of men he saw and learned their minds many pains he suffered heartsick on the open sea fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home but he could not save them from disaster hard as he strove the recklessness

has got lost and all that his shop front signboard shows is a gentleman with a lathered cheek and the inscription we also let blood woke up rather early one morning and smelt hot bread as he sat up in bed he saw his wife who was a quite respectable lady and a great coffee drinker taking some freshly baked rolls out of the oven i don t want any coffee today praskovya osipovna said ivan yakovlevich i ll make do with some hot rolls and onion instead here i must explain that ivan yakovlevich would really have liked to have had some coffee as well but knew it was quite out of the question to expect both coffee and rolls since praskovya osipovna did not take very kindly to these whims of his let the old fool have his bread i don t mind she thought that means extra coffee for me and she threw a roll on to the table ivan pulled his frock coat over his nightshirt for decency s sake sat down at the table poured out some salt peeled two onions took a knife and with a determined expression on his face started cutting one of the rolls when he had sliced the roll in two he peered into the middle and was amazed to see something white there ivan carefully picked at it with his knife and felt it with his finger quite thick he said to himself what on earth can it be he poked two fingers in and pulled out a nose he flopped back in his chair and began rubbing his eyes and feeling around in the roll again yes it was a nose all right no mistake about that and what s more it seemed a very familiar nose his face filled with horror but this horror was nothing compared with his wife s indignation you beast whose nose is that you ve cut off she cried furiously you scoundrel you drunkard i ll report it to the police myself i will you thief come to think of it i ve heard three customers say that when they come in for a shave you start pulling their noses about so much it s a wonder they stay on at all but ivan felt more dead than alive he knew that the nose belonged to none other than collegiate assessor kovalyov whom he shaved on wednesdays and sundays wait a minute praskovya i ll wrap it up in a piece of cloth and dump it in the corner let s leave it there for a bit then i ll try and get rid of it i don t want to know do you think i m going to let a sawn off nose lie about in my room you fathead all you can do is strop that blasted razor of yours and let everything else go to pot layabout night bird and you expect me to cover up for you with the police you filthy pig blockhead get that nose out of here out do what you like with it but i don t want that thing hanging around here a minute longer ivan yakovlevich was absolutely stunned he thought and thought but just didn t know what to make of it i m damned if i know what s happened he said at last scratching the back of his ear i can t say for certain if i came home drunk or not last night all i know is it s crazy after all bread is baked in an oven and you don t get noses in bakeries can t make head or tail of it ivan yakovlevich lapsed into silence the thought that the police might search the place find the nose and afterwards bring a charge against him very nearly sent him out of his mind already he could see that scarlet collar beautifully embroidered with silver that sword and he began shaking all over finally he put on his scruffy old trousers and shoes and with praskovya osipovna s vigorous invective ringing in his ears wrapped the nose up in a piece of cloth and went out into the street all he wanted was to stuff it away somewhere either hiding it between two curb stones by someone s front door or else accidentally dropping it and slinking off down a side street but as luck would have it he kept bumping into friends who would insist on asking where are you off to or it s a bit early for shaving customers isn t it with the result that he didn t have a chance to get rid of it once he did manage to drop it but a policeman pointed with his halberd and said pick that up can t you see you dropped something and ivan yakovlevich had to pick it up and hide it in his pocket despair gripped him especially as the streets were getting more and more crowded now as the shops and stalls began to open he decided to make his way to st isaac s bridge and see if he could throw the nose into the river neva without anyone seeing him but here i am rather at fault for not telling you before something about ivan yakovlevich who in many ways was a man you could respect comcore giftofmagi white fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper and then an ecstatic scream of joy and

she knew and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession and now they were hers but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone but she hugged them to her bosom and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say my hair grows so fast jim and then della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried oh oh jim had

your combs and now suppose you put the chops on the magi as you know were wise men wonderfully wise men who brought gifts to the babe in the manger they invented the art of giving christmas presents being wise their gifts were no doubt wise ones possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication and here i have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house but in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the

use me as a key she has lived for nineteen years there is all that like that has happened outside of me beyond me and when is there time to remember to sift to weigh to estimate to total i will start and there will be an interruption and i will have to gather it all together again or i will become engulfed with all i did or did not do with what should have been and what cannot be helped she was a beautiful baby the first and only one of our five that was beautiful at birth you do not guess how new and uneasy her tenancy in her now loveliness you did not know her all those years she was thought homely or see her peering over her baby pictures making me tell her over and over how beautiful she had been and would be i would tell her and was now to the seeing eye but the seeing eyes were few or

perhaps others this army has fought some notes as to tactics tactics general lee s various stratagems will be most instructive most illuminating i wonder sir if i might enlist your aid in this ah endeavor as one most closely concerned that is to be brief may i come to you when in need sure longstreet said tactics he chuckled the tactics were simple find the enemy fight him he shook his head snorting fremantle spoke softly in tones of awe one would not think of general lee now that one has met him now that one has looked him so to speak in the eye as it were one would not think him you know to be such a devious man devious longstreet swung to stare at him aghast oh my word fremantle went on devoutly but he s a tricky one the old gray fox as they say charming phrase american to the hilt devious longstreet stopped dead in the road devious he laughed aloud fremantle stared an owlish stare why colonel bless your soul there ain t a devious bone in robert lee s body don t you know that my dear sir by damn man if there is one human being in the world less devious than robert lee i aint yet met him by god and fire colonel but you amuse me and yet longstreet was not amused he leaned forward blackly across the pommel of the saddle colonel let me explain something the secret of general lee is that men love him and follow him with faith in him that s one secret the next secret is that general lee makes a decision and he moves with guts and he s been up against a lot of sickly generals who don t know how to make decisions although some of them have guts but whose men don t love them that s why we win mostly because we move with speed and faith and because we usually have the good ground tactics god man we don t win because of tricks what were the tactics at malvern hill what were the tactics at fredericksburg where we got down behind a bloody stone wall and shot the bloody hell out of them as they came up wave after wave bravest thing you ever saw because listen there are some damn good boys across the way make no mistake on that i ve fought with those boys and they know how to fight when they ve got the ground but tactics tactics he was stumbling for words but it was pouring out of him in hot clumps out of the back of the brain the words like falling coals and fremantle stared openmouthed god in heaven longstreet said and repeated it there s no strategy to this bloody war what it is is old napoleon and a hell of a lot of chivalry that s all it is what were the tactics at chancellorsville where we divided the army divided it so help me god in the face of the enemy and got away with it because joe hooker froze cold in his stomach what were the tactics yesterday what were they today and what will be the blessed tactics tomorrow i ll tell you the tactics tomorrow devious christ in heaven tomorrow we will attack an enemy that outnumbers us an enemy that outguns us an enemy dug in on the high ground and let me tell you

of the white man s wars diseases and whiskey but now it was to be blotted out because the cherokees numbered several thousands their removal to the west was planned to be in gradual stages but the discovery of appalachian gold within their territory brought on a clamor for their immediate wholesale exodus during the autumn ofgeneral winfield scott s soldiers rounded them up and concentrated them into camps a few hundred escaped to the smoky mountains and many years later where given a small reservation in north carolina from the prison camps they were started westward to indian territory on the long winter trek one of every four cherokees died from the cold hunger or disease they called the march their trail of tears the choctaws chickasaws creeks and seminoles also gave up their

nineteenth century is was still more so they alluded to him as slightly recumbent gentleman cow exact translation from the sioux is impossible but his name may be better understood if one realizes how plains indians respected and honored the bull buffalo whites considered this animal to be exceptionally stupid col dodge states without equivocation that the buffalo is the dullest creature of which he has any knowledge a herd of buffalo would graze complacently while every member was shot down he himself shot two cows and thirteen calves while the survivors grazed and watched he and others in his party had to shout and wave their hats to drive the herd away so the dead animals could be butchered indians however regarded buffalo as the wisest and most powerful of creatures nearest to the omnipresent spirit furthermore if one says in english that somebody is sitting it means he is seated balanced on the haunches but the sioux expression has an additional sense not equivalent to but approximating the english words situate and locate and reside thus from an indian point of view the name sitting bull signified a wise and powerful being who had taken up residence among them as a boy he was called slow hunkesni because of his deliberate manner and it has been alleged that his parents thought him ordinary perhaps even a bit slow in the head most biographies state that he was known also as jumping badger but stanley vestal after talking to many indians who knew his said that none of them nor any member of sitting bull s family could remember his being called jumping badger in

spheres cones and cylinders he presumably meant that he should always keep these basic solid shapes in mind when organizing his pictures but picasso and his friends decided to take this advice literally i suppose that they reasoned somewhat like this we have long given up claiming that we represent things as they appear to our eyes that was a will o the wisp which it is useless to pursue we do not want to fix on the canvas the imaginary impression of a fleeting moment let us follow cezannes example and build up the picture of our motifs as solidly and enduringly as we can why not be consistent and accept the fact that our real aim is rather to construct something rather than to copy something if we think of an object let us say a violin it does not appear before the eye of our mind the way it would appear before our bodily eyes we can and in fact do think of its various aspects at the same time some of them stand out so clearly that we feel we can touch them and handle them others are somehow blurred and this strange medley of images represents more of the real violin than any single snapshot or meticulous painting could ever contain this i suppose was the reasoning which led to such paintings as picassos still life of a violin figure in some respects it represents a return to what we have called egyptian principles in which an object was drawn from the angle from which its characteristic form came out most clearly the scroll and one peg are seen from the side as we imagine them when we think of a violin the sound holes on the other hand are seen as from in front they would not be visible from the side the curve of the rim is greatly exaggerated as we are apt to over estimate the steepness of such curves when thinking of the feeling it gives us to run our hands along the sides of such an instrument the bow and strings float somewhere in space the strings even occur twice once related to the front view once towards the volute despite this jumble of unconnected forms and there are more than i have enumerated the picture does not really look messy the reason is that the artist has constructed his picture out of more or less uniform parts so that

as the civil war it was a war fought between the confederate states of america and the states that remained in the union each side representing a distinct economy labor system and philosophy of government the southern states that formed the confederacy had agricultural economies that depended on a slave workforce and believed that any rights not granted to the federal government by the united states constitution belonged to the states the northern states were undergoing rapid industrialization which depended on wage labor and while northerners disagreed among themselves about slavery most believed it represented a direct challenge to their own rights and freedoms most also believed that a strong federal government with the ability to legislate behavior in areas not specifically set forth in the constitution was key to the growth and strength of the american republic it was inevitable that these two very distinct societies would clash for the confederates nicknamed rebels the civil war was a new war of independence for the unionists nicknamed yankees it was a war to preserve the union that had been so dearly won in the american revolution in the eyes of the four and an half million african americans enslaved and free it was a war about slavery and they wanted to be part of the fight but many northern whites did not want blacks to serve in the northern military they called it a white man s war and said that slavery was not the main point of the conflict at first northern generals actually sent escaped slaves back to their southern masters eventually the union did accept blacks into its army and navy a total ofblack men served in infantry regiments twelve heavy artillery regiments ten light artillery batteries and seven cavalry regiments black soldiers constituted twelve percent of the north s fighting forces and they suffered a disproportionate number of casualties comcore longitudeprize at six in the morning i was awaked by a great shock and a confused noise of the men on deck i ran up thinking some ship had run foul of us for by my own reckoning and that of every other person in the ship we were at least thirty five leagues distant from land but before i could reach the quarter deck the ship gave a great stroke upon the ground and the sea broke over her just after this i could perceive the land rocky rugged and uneven about two cables length from us the masts soon went overboard carrying some men with them notwithstanding a most terrible sea one of the lifeboats was launched and eight of the best men jumped into her but she had scarcely got to the ship s stern when she was hurled to the bottom and every soul in her perished the rest of the boats were soon washed to pieces on the deck we then made a raft and waited with resignation for providence to assist us from an account of the wreck of hms litchfield off the coast of north africa the litchfield came to grief because no one aboard knew where they were as the narrator tells us by his own reckoning and that of everyone else they were supposed to be thirty five leagues about a hundred miles from land the word reckoning was short for dead reckoning the system used by ships at sea to keep track of their position meaning their longitude and latitude it was an intricate system a craft and like every other craft involved the mastery of certain tools in this case such instruments as compass hourglass and quadrant it was an art as well latitude the north south position had always been the navigator s faithful guide even in ancient times a greek or roman sailor could tell how far north of the equator he was by observing the north star s height above the horizon or the sun s at noon this could be done without instruments trusting in experience and the naked eye although it is believed that an ancestor of the quadrant called the astrolabe star measurer was known to the ancients and used by them to measure the angular height of the sun or a star above the horizon phoenicians greeks and romans tended to sail along the coasts and were rarely out of sight of land as later navigators left the safety of the mediterranean to plunge into the vast atlantic far from shore and from the shorebirds that led them to it they still had the sun and the north star and these enabled them to follow imagined parallel lines of latitude that circle the globe following a line of latitude sailing the parallel kept a ship on a steady east west course christopher columbus who sailed the parallel inheld his ships on such a safe course west and west again straight on toward asia when they came across an island off the coast of what would later be called america columbus compelled his crew to sign an affidavit stating that this island was no island but mainland asia a hundred years later in shakespeare s the merchant of venice one of his characters discusses trade with mexico and the west indies as a risky but established business for the great voyages of exploration that followed columbus were followed in turn by an explosion of international commerce there was intense competition for goods and markets naval and merchant vessels jammed the familiar sea lanes the safe courses where pirates lay in wait for them piracy too had become a flourishing trade and all of them whether pirate merchant or naval vessel had to crowd into the familiar sea lanes based on latitude because longitude the east west location was not straightforward or reliable longitude was an awesome mysterious perhaps unknowable secret it was

all art forms people who can easily come to terms with a work of literature or a painting are still often baffled by the process by which a piece of music appearing in material form as notation must then be translated back into sound through the medium of a third party the performer unlike a painting a musical composition cannot be owned except by its creator and although a score may be published like a book it may remain incomprehensible to the general public until it is performed although a piece may be played thousands of times each repetition is entirely individual and interpretations by different players may vary widely origins of musical notation the earliest musical compositions were circumscribed by the range of the human voice people from all cultures have always sung or used primitive instruments to make sounds notation or the writing down of music developed to enable performers to remember what they had improvised to preserve what they had created and to facilitate interaction between more than one performer musical notation like language has ancient origins dating back to the middle east in the third millennium bc the ancient greeks appear to have been the first to try to represent variations of musical pitch through the medium of the alphabet and successive civilizations all over the world attempted to formulate similar systems of recognizable musical notation neumatic notation the earliest surviving western european notational system was called neumatic notation a system of symbols which attempted to portray the rise and fall of a melodic line these date back to the th century ad and were associated with the performance of sacred music particularly plainsong in monastic institutions several early manuscript sources contain sacred texts with accompanying notation although there was no standard system the first appearance of staff notation in which pitch was indicated by noteheads on or between lines with a symbol called a clef at the beginning to fix the pitch of one note was in the th century french treatise musica enchiriadis at the same time music for instruments particularly organ and lute was beginning to be written down in diagrammatic form known as tablature which indicated the positions of the players fingers comcore beforecolumbus if you asked modern scientists to name the worldos greatest achievements in genetic engineering you might be surprised by one of their low tech answers maize scientists know that maize called corn in the united states was created more thanyears ago although exactly how this well know plant was invented is still a mystery they do know where it was invented in the narrow waist of southern mexico this jumble of mountains beaches wet tropical forests and dry plains is the most ecologically diverse part of mesoamerica today it is the home of more than a dozen different indian groups but the human history of these hills and valleys stretches far into the past from hunting to gathering to farming aboutyears ago a group of paleoindians was living in caves in what is now the mexican state of puebla these people were hunters but they did not bring down mastodons and mammoths those huge species were already extinct now and then they even feasted on giant turtles which were probably a lot easier to catch than the fast moving deer and rabbits over the nextyears though game animals grew scarce maybe the people of the area had been too successful at hunting maybe as the climate grew slowly hotter and drier the grasslands where the animals lived shrank and so the animal populations shrank as well perhaps the situation was a combination of these two reasons whatever the explanation hunters of puebla and the neighboring state of oaxaca turned to plants for more of their food their lives and their diets were shaped by the rhythm of the seasons for most of the year individual families lived by themselves moving from place to place during the winter they hunted in spring and fall they gathered seeds and fruits by summer one of their favorite foods cactus leaves was plentiful enough to feed larger groups with enough food available or people might gather in a band to spend the season together meanwhile the people kept learning about their environment they discovered that the thick leaved cactus like agave plants could be eaten if they were first roasted over a fire they found a way to make acorns into nutritious food grind them into powder then soak the powder in water and let it dry along the way people might have noticed the seed they threw into the garbage one year would sprout as new plants the next year at some point they started to intentionally scatter seed so that they would have food to gather during the next growing season they were practicing agriculture this happened in many places across southern mexico people began to grow food crops that are still harvested across mesoamerica toady squash gourds and peppers then came maize comcore elements definitions a point is that of which there is no part and a line is a length without breadth and the extremities of a line are points a straight line is whatever lies evenly with points upon itself and a surface is that which has length and breadth alone and the extremities of a surface are lines a plane surface is whatever lies evenly with straight lines upon itself and a plane angle is the inclination of the lines when two lines in a plane meet one another and are not laid down straight on with respect to one another and when the lines containing the angle are straight then the angle is called rectilinear and when a straight line stood upon another straight line makes adjacent angles which are equal to one another each of the equal angles is a right angle and the former straight line is called perpendicular to that upon which it stands an obtuse angle is greater than a right angle and an acute angle is less than a right angle a boundary is that which is the extremity of something a figure is that which is contained by some boundary or boundaries a circle is a plane figure contained by a single line which is called a circumference such that all of the straight lines radiating towards the circumference from a single point lying inside the figure are equal to one another and the point is called the center of the circle and a diameter of the circle is any straight line being drawn through the center which is brought to an end in each direction by the circumference of the circle and any such straight line cuts the circle in half and a semi circle is the figure contained by the diameter and the circumference it cuts off and the center of the semi circle is the same point as the center of the circle rectilinear figures are those figures contained by straight lines trilateral figures being contained by three straight lines quadrilateral by four and multilateral by more than four and of the trilateral figures an equilateral triangle is that having three equal sides an isosceles triangle that having only two equal sides and a scalene triangle that having three unequal sides and further of the trilateral figures a right angled triangle is that having a right angle an obtuse angled triangle that having an obtuse angle and an acute angled triangle that having three acute angles and of the quadrilateral figures a square is that which is right angled and equilateral a rectangle that which is right angled but not equilateral a rhombus that which is equilateral but not right angled and a rhomboid that having opposite sides and angles equal to one another which is neither right angled nor equilateral and let quadrilateral figures besides these be called trapezia parallel lines are straight lines which being in the same plane and being produced to infinity in each direction meet with one another in neither of these directions postulates let it have been postulated to draw a straight line from any point to any point and to produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line and to draw a circle with any center and radius and that all right angles are equal to one another and that if a straight line falling across two other straight lines makes internal angles on the same side of itself less than two right angles being produced to infinity the two other straight lines meet on that side of the original straight line that the internal angles are less than two right angles and do not meet on the other side common notions things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another and if equal things are added to equal things then the wholes are equal and if equal things are subtracted from equal things then the remainders are equal and things coinciding with one another are equal to one another and the whole is greater than the part proposition to construct an equilateral triangle on a given finite straight line let ab be the given finite straight line so it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight line ab let the circle bcd with center a and radius ab have been drawn post and again let the circle ace with center b and radius ba have been drawn post and let the straight lines ca and cb have been joined from the point c where the circles cut one another to the points a and b respectively post and since the point a is the center of the circle cdb ac is equal to ab def again since the point b is the center of the circle cae bc is equal to ba def but ca was also shown to be equal to ab thus ca and cb are each equal to ab but things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another c n thus ca is also equal to cb thus the three straight lines ca ab and bc are equal to one another thus the triangle abc is equilateral and has been constructed on the given finite straight line ab which is the very thing it was required to do comcore classifyingstars sunlight and starlight are composed of waves of various lengths which the eye even aided by a telescope is unable to separate we must use more than a telescope in order to sort out the component colors the light must be dispersed by a prism or split up by some other means for instance sunbeams passing through rain drops are transformed into the myriad tinted rainbow the familiar rainbow spanning the sky is nature s most glorious demonstration that light is composed of many colors the very beginning of our knowledge of the nature of a star dates back towhen isaac newton gave to the world the results of his experiments on passing sunlight through a prism to describe the beautiful band of rainbow tints produced when sunlight was dispersed by his three cornered piece of glass he took from the latin the word spectrum meaning an appearance the rainbow is the spectrum of the sun inmore than a century after newton the spectrum of the sun was obtained in such purity that an amazing detail was seen and studied by the german optician fraunhofer he saw that the multiple spectral tings ranging from delicate violet to deep red were crossed by hundreds of fine dark lines in other words there were narrow gaps in the spectrum where certain shades were wholly blotted out we must remember that the word spectrum is applied not only to sunlight but also to the light of any glowing substance when its rays are sorted out by a prism or a grating each substance thus treated sends out its own vibrations of particular wave lengths which may be likened to singing its own song now the spectrum of salt called sodium chloride by chemists is very simple and includes two bright yellow lines in the spectrum of the sun exactly the same shades of yellow are cut out by two black lines could there be any connection could the earthly yellow lines be made to change to black yes it was found by experiment that they would do so instantly if a cooler vapor of salt were placed between the prism and a source of light that emits all wave lengths thus it was reasoned that some of the bright yellow light from the sun s hot surface was absorbed by cooler sodium vapors in the sun s atmosphere likewise two thousand black lines in the sun s spectrum were traced to iron and indeed all the common substances so familiar to us here on the earth have been found to exist in the sun by comparing its absorption spectrum with the bright line spectra given by these substances in laboratories comcore biographyatom the birth began in a young star a young star is a mass of hydrogen nuclei because the star is hot about thirteen million degrees at the center the nuclei cannot hold on to their electrons the electrons wander around the nuclei of hydrogen that is the protons are moving about very fast too from time to time one proton runs headlong into another when this happens one of the protons loses its electric charge and changes into a neutron the pair then cling together as a single nucleus of heavy hydrogen this nucleus will in time capture another proton now there is a nucleus with two protons and one neutron called light helium when two of these nuclei smash into each other two protons are expelled in the process this creates a nucleus of helium with two protons and two neutrons this is the fundamental process of fusion by which the primitive hydrogen of the universe is built up into a new basic material helium in this process energy is given off in the form of heat and light that make the stars shine it is the first stage in the birth of the heavier atoms after billions of years the star now no longer young has a central core of almost pure helium the helium nuclei begin to run into one another headlong every so often two helium nuclei crash together to form a nucleus of four protons four neutrons this is called a beryllium nucleus it is not the stable beryllium that we know on earth which has another neutron is called beryllium beryllium is an unstable isotope that has a fantastically short life flies apart almost as soon as it is formed less than a millionth of a millionth of a second only if another helium nucleus crashes into the table beryllium nucleus in the brief moment its life do the parts remain together and form sew stable nucleus of six protons and six neutrons this is the moment when a carbon nucleus truly born the atom of carbon whose story are telling was born by this extraordinary chance billions of years ago how then does the carbon atom get out of star and come here to earth the aging star goes on building up carbon atoms and other heavier atoms from its helium finally these nuclear reactions stop the star collapses the temperature rises suddenly and the star explodes scattering the carbon and other atoms through space there they become mixed with the dust and thin sea of hydrogen gas which fill space later when a fresh star begins to form from hydrogen gas and dust it catches up some the carbon and other atoms with it there fresh stars being formed like this all the time and one of these fresh stars is the sun which was formed four or five billion years ago later the earth and the other planets were formed from the sun the carbon atom was part of the earth when it was formed the carbon atom has been part of many different things dead and alive since the earth began it has joined with other atoms broken away and then joined other atoms again but always it has remained the same carbon atom at one time the carbon atom may have been part of a diamond a pure crystal of carbon or it may have joined with two atoms of oxygen to form the gas carbon dioxide the carbon dioxide may have entered through the pores of a leaf and been used to make sugar when the sunlight struck it there the sugar became part of the tissues of the plant that plant may have become peat or coal when the plant died and fell to the ground bacteria broke some of it down into simpler chemical substances ammonia water and carbon dioxide the carbon dioxide may have escaped into the air and been used again by other plants but most of the carbon in the plant tissue remained in the ground with other dead plants around it the plant got pressed down by layers of sand mud and water that settled on it over millions of years the plants changed and hardened until they became hard coal deep in the ground the carbon atom may have been locked in the coal for millions of years but one day it was dug out of the earth when the coal was burned the carbon atom joined the oxygen again and formed carbon dioxide the next time it entered through the pores of a leaf into a plant it was used again to make sugar the plant was perhaps eaten by a cow one of your forefathers may have drunk the milk of that cow or eaten a steak from it and the carbon atom might have been in either in the body of your forefather the carbon atom became part of one of the chromosomes which was passed on to your parents and then to you you may pass this carbon atom to a son or daughter or perhaps you will die with this carbon atom still in your body but the career of the carbon atom is not over it will return to the soil and from there it may get into the air again as carbon dioxide and pass in and out of the lungs of human beings for thousands of years the air in a man s lungs at any moment contains atoms so sooner or later every one of us breathes an atom that has been breathed by someone who has lived before us perhaps michelangelo or george washington or moses your carbon atom linked with atoms of oxygen may be breathed by some great man or woman of the future then it may return again to the soil and lie dormant in some mineral for millions of years and in time its cycle of life may begin again will this cycle ever end we do not know your carbon atom has been unchanged as an atom for four billion years or more and there is no reason why it should not go on forever even if the earth is burned up at last by the sun your carbon atom may go back into space and be swept again into some new star in a star and only in a star will its identity finally disappear it will be broken apart by violent atomic collisions and its pieces built into other atoms then and only then will the career of your carbon atom be at an end but it will be part of new atoms of a different kind and in this sense it will go on forever a never ending link between you and the stars comcore amusementparkphysics the rides in an amusement park not only are fun but also demonstrate principles of physics among them are rotational dynamics and energy conversion i have been exploring the rides at geauga lake amusement park near cleveland and have found that nearly every ride offers a memorable lesson to me the scariest rides at the park are the roller coasters the big dipper is similar to many of the roller coasters that have thrilled passengers for most of this century the cars are pulled by chain t the top of the highest hill along the track released from the chain as the front of the car begins its descent the unpowered cars have almost no speed and only a small acceleration as more cars get onto the downward slope the acceleration increases it peaks when all the cars are headed downward the peak value is the product of the acceleration generated by gravity and the sine of the slope of the track a steeper descent generates a greater acceleration but packing the coaster with heavier passengers does not when the coaster reaches the bottom of the valley and starts up the next hill there is an instant when the cars are symmetrically distributed in the valley the acceleration is zero as more cars ascend the coaster begins to slow reaching its lowest speed just as it is symmetrically positioned at the top of the hill a roller coaster functions by means of transfers of energy when the chain hauls the cars to the top of the first hill it does work on the cars endowing them with gravitational potential energy the energy of a body in a gravitational field with respect to the distance of the body from some reference level such as the ground as the cars descend into the first valley much of the stored energy is transferred into kinetic energy the energy of motion if the loss of energy to friction and air drag is small the total of the potential and kinetic energies must remain constant throughout the descent and even throughout the rest of the ride the coaster gains kinetic energy and speed at the expense of potential energy if the first valley is at ground level the transfer is complete and for a moment the coaster has all its energy in the form of kinetic energy without energy losses the coaster could climb any number of hills as high as the one from which it is released but no higher to be sure friction and air drag do remove energy from the coaster and its total energy content dwindles it can no longer climb high hills which is why the last stages of the track consist only of low hills comcore lifebythenumbers though animals come in many shapes and sizes there are definite limits on the possible size of an animal of a particular shape king kong simply could not exist for instance as labarbara has calculated if you were to take a gorilla and blow it up to the size of king kong its weight would increase by more thantimes but the size of its bones would increase by only a few hundred times kongs bones would simply not be able to support his body he would collapse under his own weight and the same is true for all those giant locusts giant ants and the like imagining giants giant people giant animals or giant insects might prove the basis for an entertaining story but the rules of science say that giants could not happen you cant have a giant anything if you want to change size you have to change to overall design the reason is quite simple suppose you double the height or length of any creature say a gorilla the weight will increase times i e cubed but the cross section of the bones will increase only fourfold squared or if you increase the height of the gorilla times the weight will increase times cubed but the cross sectional area of the bones will increase only times squared in general when you increase the height by a certain factor the weight will increase by the cube of that factor but the cross section of the bone will increase only by the square of that factor this simple relationship between the increase in length area and volume and hence weight since weight depends on volume on how much material there is is most easily imagined by thinking of a sugar cube suppose you wanted to make a giant sugar cube three times the size of the original cube by sticking together lots of ordinary sugar cubes to make a sugar cube a mere three times the size of the original one it also has to be three times deeper and three times taller that means you need x x cubes altogether a cross section of the giant sugar cube on the other hand has only nine x cubes in it so cross section increases faster than height times faster in the case of the sugar cube but volume and hence weight goes up much more rapidly times for the sugar cube comcore racetosave any species in nature from the tiniest insect to the blue whale is a collection

mostly it ate grubs the larvae of beetles certain kinds of beetle would attack a dying or injured tree by boring through the bark to lay their eggs which hatched into stout wormlike creatures the

a branch of mathematics began with gambling pierre de fermat of the famous last theorem blaise pascal and the bernoullis wanted to know the mathematical odds of winning at the card table probability didn t tell them for certain that they would or wouldn t draw an ace it just told them how likely it was a deck of cards has aces so the odds of the first drawn card being an ace are in or in if cards have been played and not an ace among them those odds improve to in in always keep in mind that probability is about the likelihood of outcomes not the certainty if there are only cards left in the deck and no aces have been played you can predict with certainty that the next card will be an ace but you re not using probability you re using fact probability is central to the physics that deals

the astrolabe the astrolabe in greek star reckoner is a manual computing and observation device with myriad uses in astronomy time keeping surveying navigation and astrology the principles behind the most common variety the planispheric astrolabe were first laid down in antiquity by the greeks who pioneered the notion of projecting three dimensional images on flat surfaces the device reached a high degree of refinement in the medieval islamic world where it was invaluable for determining prayer times and the direction of mecca from anywhere in the muslim world the astrolabe was introduced to europe by the eleventh century where is saw wide use until the renaissance the fundamental innovation underlying the astrolabe was the projection of an image of the sky usually the northern hemisphere centered on polaris on a plane corresponding to the earths equator this image which was typically etched on a brass plate was inserted into a round frame the mater whose circumference was marked in degrees or hours over the plate was fitted a lattice work disk the rete with pointers to indicate the positions of major stars a metal hand similar to those on a clock was hinged with the rete at the center of the instrument as was a sighting vane the alidade for determining the angular height of the stars or other features such as mountaintops the entire device was usually not more than six to eight inches in diameter and half an inch thick one common use of the astrolabe was to determine the time of day even after dark other uses included determination of sunrise and sunset times for any date past or future predicting eclipses finding important stars or constellations and measuring the height of earthbound objects and the circumference of the earth for this and other reasons the astrolabe has been called the worlds first personal computer comcore poetics completeness we have laid down that tragedy is an imitation of a complete i e whole action possessing a certain magnitude there is such a thing as a whole which possesses no magnitude a whole is that which has a beginning a middle and an end a beginning is that which itself does not follow necessarily from anything else but some second thing naturally exists or occurs after it conversely an end is that which does itself naturally follow from something else either necessarily or in general but there is nothing else after it a middle is that which itself comes after something else and some other thing comes after it well constructed plots should therefore not begin or end at any arbitrary point but should employ the stated forms magnitude any beautiful object whether a living organism or any other entity composed of parts must not only possess those parts in proper order but its magnitude also should not be arbitrary beauty consists in magnitude as well as order for this reason no organism could be beautiful if it is excessively small since observation becomes confused as it comes close to having no perceptible duration in time or excessively large since the observation is then not simultaneous and the observers find that the sense of unity and wholeness is lost from their observation e g if there were an animal a thousand miles long so just as in the case of physical objects and living organisms they should possess a certain magnitude and this should be such as can readily be taken in at one view so in the case of plots they should have a certain length and this should be such as can readily be held in memory the definition of length which is determined by theatrical performances and perception is not relevant to the art of poetry if it were necessary to perform a hundred tragedies they would time the performances by the clock as they say used to be done on other occasions but the definition which agrees with the actual nature of the matter is that invariably the greater the plot is up to the limits of simultaneous perspicuity the more beautiful it is with respect to magnitude or to state a straightforward definition the magnitude in which a series of events occurring sequentially in accordance with probability or necessity gives rise to a change from good fortune to bad fortune or from bad fortune to good fortuneis an adequate definition of magnitude unity a plot is not as some think unified because it is concerned with a single person an indeterminately large number of things happen to any one person not all of which constitute a unity likewise a single individual performs many actions and they do not make up a single action so it is clear that a mistake has been made by all those poets who have composed a heracleid or theseid or poems of that kind on the assumption that just because heracles was one person the plot too is bound to be unified just as homer excels in other respects he seems to have seen this point clearly as well whether through art or instinct when he composed the odyssey he did not include everything which happened to odysseus e g the wounding on parnassus and the pretence of madness during the mobilization the occurrence of either of these events did not make the occurrence of the other necessary or probably instead he constructed the odyssey about a single action of the kind we are discussing the same is true of the iliad determinate structure just as in other imitative arts the imitation is unified if it imitates a single object so too the plot as the imitation of an action should imitate a single unified action and one that is also a whole so the structure of the various sections of the events must be such that the transposition or removal of any one section dislocates and changes the whole if the presence or absence of something has no discernible effect it is not a part of the

in a selection of language really used by men and at the same time to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect and further and above all to make these incidents and situations interesting by tracing in them truly though not ostentatiously the primary laws of our nature chiefly as far as regards the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of excitement humble and rustic life was generally chosen because in that condition the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity are less under restraint and speak a plainer and more emphatic language because in that condition of life our elementary feelings coexist in a state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and more forcibly communicated because the manners of rural life germinate from those elementary feelings and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more easily comprehended and are more durable and lastly because in that condition the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature the language too of these men has been adopted purified indeed from what appear to be its real defects from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is originally derived and because from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse being less under the influence of social vanity they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions accordingly such a language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent and a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it by poets who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites of their own creation comcore

kiss ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with these war like preparations which cover our waters and darken our land are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love let us not deceive ourselves sir these are the implements of war and subjugation the last arguments to which kings resort i ask gentlemen sir what means this martial array if its purpose be not to force us to submission can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it has great britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies no sir she has none they are meant for us they can be meant for no other they are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the british ministry have been so long forging and what have we to oppose to them shall we try argument sir we have been trying that for the last ten years have we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted let us not i beseech you sir deceive ourselves sir we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on we have petitioned we have remonstrated we have supplicated we have prostrated ourselves before the throne and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament our petitions have been slighted our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult our supplications have been disregarded and we have been spurned with contempt from the foot of the throne in vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation there is no longer any room for hope if we wish to be free if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained we must fight i repeat it sir we must fight an appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so formidable an adversary but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week or the next year will it be when we are totally disarmed and when a british guard shall be stationed in every house shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature hath placed in our power three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just god who presides over the destinies of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave besides sir we have no election if we were base enough to desire it it is now too late to retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery our chains are forged their clanking may be heard on the plains of boston the war is inevitable and let it come i repeat it sir let it come it is in vain sir to extenuate the matter gentlemen may cry peace peace but there is no peace the war is actually begun the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms our brethren are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death comcore secondinaugural fellow countrymen at this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper now at the expiration of four years during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation little that is new could be presented the progress of our arms upon which all else chiefly depends is as well known to the public as to myself and it is i trust reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all with high hope for the future no prediction in regard to it is ventured on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war all dreaded it all sought to avert it while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place devoted altogether to saving the union without war urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to dissolve the union and divide effects by negotiation both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came one eighth of the whole population were colored slaves not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease each looked for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just god s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men s faces but let us judge not that we be not judged the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully the almighty has his own purposes woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which in the providence of god must needs come but which having continued through his appointed time he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations comcore stateofunion for there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy the basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple they are equality of opportunity for youth and for others jobs for those who can work security for those who need it the ending of special privilege for the few the preservation of civil liberties for all the enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living these are the simple basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our modern world the inner and abiding strength of our economic and political systems is dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these expectations many subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate improvement as examples we should bring more citizens under the coverage of old age pensions and unemployment insurance we should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care we should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing gainful employment may obtain it i have called for personal sacrifice i am assured of the willingness of almost all americans to respond to that call a part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes in my budget message i shall recommend that a greater portion of this great defense program be paid for from taxation than we are paying today no person should try or be allowed to get rich out of this program and the principle of tax payments in accordance with ability to pay should be constantly before our eyes to guide our legislation if the congress maintains these principles the voters putting patriotism ahead of pocketbooks will give you their applause in the future days which we seek to make secure we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms the first is freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world the second is freedom of every person to worship god in his own way everywhere in the world the third is freedom from want which translated into world terms means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants everywhere in the world the fourth is freedom from fear which translated into world terms means a world wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world comcore iamanamerican we have gathered here to affirm a faith a faith in a common purpose a common conviction a common devotion some of us have chosen america as the land of our adoption the rest have come from those who did the same for this reason we have some right to consider ourselves a picked group a group of those who had the courage to break from the past and brave the dangers and the loneliness of a strange land what was the object that nerved us or those who went before us to this choice we sought liberty freedom from oppression freedom from want freedom to be ourselves this we then sought this we now believe that we are by way of winning what do we mean when we say that first of all we seek liberty i often wonder whether we do not rest our hopes too much upon constitutions upon laws and upon courts these are false hopes believe me these are false hopes liberty lies in the hearts of men and women when it dies there no constitution no law no court can even do much to help it while it lies there it needs no constitution no law no court to save it and what is this liberty which must lie in the hearts of men and women it is not the ruthless the unbridled will it is not freedom to do as one likes that is the denial of liberty and leads straight to its overthrow a society in which men recognize no check upon their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few as we have learned to our sorrow what then is the spirit of liberty i cannot define it i can only tell you my own faith the spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the mind of other men and women the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded the spirit of liberty is the spirit of him who near two thousand years ago taught mankind that lesson it has never learned but never quite forgotten that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest and now in that spirit that spirit of an america which has never been and which may never be nay which never will be except as the conscience and courage of americans create it yet in the spirit of that america which lies hidden in some form in the aspirations of us all in the spirit of that america for which our young men are at this moment fighting and dying in that spirit of liberty and of america i ask you to rise and with me pledge our faith in the glorious destiny of our beloved country comcore remarkstothesenate mr president i would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national condition it is a national feeling of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide and the end of everything that we americans hold dear it is a condition that comes from the lack of effective leadership in either the legislative branch or the executive branch of our government that leadership is so lacking that serious and responsible proposals are being made that national advisory commissions be appointed to provide such critically needed leadership i speak as briefly as possible because too much harm has already been done with irresponsible words of bitterness and selfish political opportunism i speak as briefly as possible because the issue is too great to be obscured by eloquence i speak simply and briefly in the hope that my words will be taken to heart i speak as a republican i speak as a woman i speak as a united states senator i speak as an american the united states senate has long enjoyed worldwide respect as the greatest deliberative body in the world but recently that deliberative character has too often been debased to the level of a forum of hate and character assassination sheltered by the shield of congressional immunity it is ironical that we senators can in debate in the senate directly or indirectly by any form of words impute to any american who is not a senator any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming an american and without that non senator american having any legal redress against us yet if we say the same thing in the senate about our colleagues we can be stopped on the grounds of being out of order it is strange that we can verbally attack anyone else without restraint and with full protection and yet we hold ourselves above the same type of criticism here on the senate floor surely the united states senate is big enough to take self criticism and self appraisal surely we should be able to take the same kind of character attacks that we dish out to outsiders i think that it is high time for the united states senate and its members to do some soul searching for us to weigh our consciences on the manner in which we are performing our duty to the people of america on the manner in which we are using or abusing our individual powers and privileges i think that it is high time that we remembered that we have sworn to uphold and defend the constitution i think that it is high time that we remembered that the constitution as amended speaks not only of the freedom of speech but also of trial by jury instead of trial by accusation whether it be a criminal prosecution in court or a character prosecution in the senate there is little practical distinction when the life of a person has been ruined those of us who shout the loudest about americanism in making character assassinations are all too frequently those who by our own words and acts ignore some of the basic principles of americanism the right to criticize the right to hold unpopular beliefs the right to protest the right of independent thought the exercise of these rights should not cost one single american citizen his reputation or his right to a livelihood nor should he be in danger of losing his reputation or livelihood merely because he happens to know someone who holds unpopular beliefs who of us doesn t otherwise none of us could call our souls our own otherwise thought control would have set in the american people are sick and tired of being afraid to speak their minds lest they be politically smeared as communists or fascists by their opponents freedom of speech is not what it used to be in america it has been so abused by some that it is not exercised by others the american people are sick and tired of seeing innocent people smeared and guilty people whitewashed but there have been enough proved cases such as the amerasia case the hiss case the coplon case the gold case to cause the nationwide distrust and strong suspicion that there may be something to the unproved sensational accusations i doubt if the republican party could simply because i don t believe the american people will uphold any political party that puts political exploitation above national interest surely we republicans aren t that desperate for victory i don t want to see the republican party win that way while it might be a fleeting victory for the republican party it would be a more lasting defeat for the american people surely it would ultimately be suicide for the republican party and the two party system that has protected our american liberties from the dictatorship of a one party system as members of the minority party we do not have the primary authority to formulate the policy of our government but we do have the responsibility of rendering constructive criticism of clarifying issues of allaying fears by acting as responsible citizens as a woman i wonder how the mothers wives sisters and daughters feel about the way in which members of their families have been politically mangled in the senate debate and i use the word debate advisedly as a united states senator i am not proud of the way in which the senate has been made a publicity platform for irresponsible sensationalism i am not proud of the reckless abandon in which unproved charges have been hurled from the side of the aisle i am not proud of the obviously staged undignified countercharges that have been attempted in retaliation from the other side of the aisle i don t like the way the senate has been made a rendezvous for vilification for selfish political gain at the sacrifice of individual reputations and national unity i am not proud of the way we smear outsiders from the floor of the senate and hide behind the cloak of congressional immunity and still place ourselves beyond criticism on the floor of the senate as an american i am shocked at the way republicans and democrats alike are playing directly into the communist design of confuse divide and conquer as an american i don t want a democratic administration whitewash or cover up any more than a want a republican smear or witch hunt as an american i condemn a republican fascist just as much i condemn a democratic communist i condemn a democrat fascist just as much as i condemn a republican communist they are equally dangerous to you and me and to our country as an american i want to see our nation recapture the strength and unity it once had when we fought the enemy instead of ourselves it is with these thoughts that i have drafted what i call a declaration of conscience i am gratified that senator tobey senator aiken senator morse senator ives senator thye and senator hendrickson have concurred in that declaration and have authorized me to announce their concurrence comcore addressmarchwashington five score years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity but one hundred years later the negro still is not free one hundred years later the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity one hundred years later the negro is still languished in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land and so we ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition in a sense we ve come to our nation s capital to cash a check when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir this note was a promise that all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned instead of honoring this sacred obligation america has given the negro people a bad check a check which has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation and so we ve come to cash this check a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism now is the time to make real the promises of democracy now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood now is the time to make justice a reality for all of god s children it would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment this sweltering summer of the negro s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality nineteen sixty three is not an end but a beginning and those who hope that the negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual and there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the negro is granted his citizenship rights the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges but there is something that i must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice in the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force the marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom we cannot walk alone and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back there are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights when will you be satisfied we can never be satisfied as long as the negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities we cannot be satisfied as long as the negro s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating for whites only we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote no no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream i am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells and some of you have come from areas where your quest quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality you have been the veterans of creative suffering continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive go back to mississippi go back to alabama go back to south carolina go back to georgia go back to louisiana go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed let us not wallow in the valley of despair i say to you today my friends that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi a state sweltering with the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character i have a dream today i have a dream that one day down in alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers i have a dream today i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together this is our hope and this is the faith with which i return to the south with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood with this faith we will be able to work together to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together to stand up for freedom together knowing that we will be free one day and this will be the day this will be the day when all of god s children will be able to sing with new meaning my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing land where my fathers died land of the pilgrim s pride from every mountainside let freedom ring and if america is to be a great nation this must become true and so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of new hampshire let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york let freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania let freedom ring from the snow capped rockies of colorado let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california but not only that let freedom ring from stone mountain of georgia let freedom ring from lookout mountain of tennessee let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippi from every mountainside let freedom ring and when this happens when we allow freedom ring when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet from every state and every city we will be able to speed up that day when all of god s children black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics

changing disparate parts it is held together by a notion the notion that all men are created equal though everyone knows that most men consider themselves better than someone of all the nations in the world the united states was built in nobody s image the historian daniel boorstin wrote that s because it was built of bits and pieces that seem discordant like the crazy quilts that have been one of its great folk art forms velvet and calico and checks and brocades out of many one that is the ideal the reality is often quite different a great national striving consisting frequently of failure many of the oft told stories of the most pluralistic nation on earth are stories not of tolerance but of bigotry slavery and sweatshops the burning of crosses and the ostracism of the other children learn in social studies class and in the news of the lynching of blacks the denial of rights to women the murders of gay men it is difficult to know how to convince them that this amounts to crown thy good with brotherhood that amid all the failures is something spectacularly successful perhaps they understand it at this moment when enormous tragedy as it so often does demands a time of reflection on enormous blessings this is a nation founded on a conundrum what mario cuomo has characterized as community added to individualism these two are our defining ideals they are also in constant conflict historians today bemoan the ascendancy of a kind of prideful apartheid in america saying that the clinging to ethnicity in background and custom has undermined the concept of unity these

cambodians and the mexicans in california coexist less easily today than did the irish and italians of massachusetts a century ago you know the answer what is the point of this splintered whole what is the point of a nation in which arab cabbies chauffeur jewish passengers through the streets of new york and in which jewish cabbies chauffeur arab passengers too and yet speak in theory of hatred one for the other what is the point of a nation in which one part seems to be always on the verge of fisticuffs with another blacks and whites gays and straights left and right pole and chinese and puerto rican and slovenian other countries with such divisions have in fact divided into new nations with new names but not this one impossibly interwoven even in its hostilities once these disparate parts were held together by a common enemy by the fault lines of world wars and the electrified fence of communism with the end of the cold war there was the creeping concern that without a focus for hatred and distrust a sense of national identity would evaporate that the left side of the hyphen african american mexican american irish american would overwhelm the right and slow growing domestic traumas like economic unrest and increasing crime seemed more likely to emphasize division than community today the citizens of the united states have come together once more because of armed conflict and enemy attack terrorism has led to devastation and unity yet even inthe overwhelming majority of those surveyed by the national opinion research center agreed with this statement the u s is a unique country that stands for something special in the world one of the things that it stands for is this vexing notion that a great nation can consist entirely of refugees from other nations that people of different even warring religions and cultures can live if not side by side than on either side of the country s chester avenues faced with this diversity there is little point in trying to isolate anything remotely resembling a national character but there are two strains of behavior that however tenuously abet the concept of unity there is that calvinist undercurrent in the american psyche that loves the difficult the demanding that sees mastering the impossible whether it be prairie or subway as a test of character and so glories in the struggle of this fractured coalescing and there is a grudging fairness among the citizens of the united states that eventually leads most to admit that no matter what the english only advocates try to suggest the new immigrants are not so

tolerance is a vanilla pudding word standing for little more than the allowance of letting others live unremarked and unmolested pride seems excessive given the american willingness to endlessly complain about them them being whoever is new different unknown or currently under suspicion but patriotism is partly taking pride in this unlikely ability to throw all of us together in a country that across its length and breadth is as different as a dozen countries and still be able to call it by one name when photographs of the faces of all those who died in the world trade center

been wandering indeed in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning but since dinner mrs reed when there was no company dined early the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre and a rain so penetrating that further out door exercise was now out of the question i was glad of it i never liked long walks especially on chilly afternoons dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight with nipped fingers and toes and a heart saddened by the chidings of bessie the nurse and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to eliza john and georgiana reed the said eliza john and georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing room she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside and with her darlings about her for the time neither quarrelling nor crying looked perfectly happy me she had dispensed from joining the group saying she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance but that until she heard from bessie and could discover by her own observation that i was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition a more attractive and sprightly manner something lighter franker more natural as it were she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented happy little children what does bessie say i have done i asked jane i dont like cavillers or questioners besides there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner be seated somewhere and until you can speak pleasantly remain silent a breakfast room adjoined the drawing room i slipped in there it contained a bookcase i soon possessed myself of a volume taking care that it should be one stored with pictures i mounted into the window seat gathering up my feet i sat cross legged like a

be nipped in the bud you are absolutely right where does he get the tobacco from your table he does in that case send him to me when the governess had gone bilovsky sat down in an easy chair before his writing table and began to think for some reason he pictured to himself his seriozha enveloped in clouds of tobacco smoke with a huge yard long cigarette in his mouth and this caricature made him smile at the same time the earnest anxious face of the governess awakened in him memories of days long past and half forgotten when smoking at school and in the nursery aroused in masters and parents a strange almost incomprehensible horror it really was horror children were unmercifully flogged and expelled from school and their lives were blighted although not one of the teachers nor fathers knew exactly what constituted the harm and offence of smoking even very intelligent people did not hesitate to combat the vice they did not understand bilovsky called to mind the principal of his school a highly educated good natured old man who was so shocked when he caught a scholar with a cigarette that he would turn pale and immediately summon a special session of the school board and sentence the offender to expulsion no doubt that is one of the laws of society the less an evil is understood the more bitterly and harshly it is attacked the attorney thought of the two or three boys who had been expelled and of their subsequent lives and could not but reflect that punishment is in many cases more productive of evil than crime itself the living organism possesses the faculty of quickly adapting itself to every condition if it were not so man would be conscious every moment of the unreasonable foundations on which his reasonable actions rest and how little of justice and assurance are to be found even in those activities which are fraught with so much responsibility and which are so appalling in their consequences such as education literature the law and thoughts such as these came floating into bilovsky s head light evanescent thoughts such as only enter weary resting brains one knows not whence they are nor why they come they stay but a short while and seem to spread across the surface of the brain without ever sinking very far into its depths for those whose minds for hours and days together are forced to be occupied with business and to travel always along the same lines these homelike untrammelled musings bring a sort of comfort and a pleasant restfulness of their own it was nine o clock on the floor overhead someone was pacing up and down and still higher up on the third storey four hands were playing scales on the piano the person who was pacing the floor seemed from his nervous strides to be the victim of tormenting thoughts or of the toothache his footsteps and the monotonous scales added to the quiet of the evening something somnolent that predisposed the mind to idle reveries in the nursery two rooms away seriozha and his governess were talking pa pa has come sang the boy papa has co ome pa pa pa votre pere vous appelle allez vite cried the governess twittering like a frightened bird what shall i say to him thought bilovsky but before he had time to think of anything to say his son seriozha had already entered the study this was a little person whose sex could only be divined from his clothes he was so delicate and fair and frail his body was as languid as a hot house plant and everything about him looked wonderfully dainty and soft his movements his curly hair his glance his velvet tunic good evening papa he said in a gentle voice climbing on to his father s knee and swiftly kissing his neck did you send for me wait a bit wait a bit master answered the lawyer putting him aside before you and i kiss each other we must have a talk a serious talk i am angry with you and i don t love you any more do you understand that young man i don t love you and you are no son of mine seriozha looked steadfastly at his father and then turned his regard to the table and shrugged his shoulders what have i done he asked perplexed and blinked i didn t go into your study once today and i haven t touched a thing miss natalie has just been complaining to me that you have been smoking is that so have you been smoking yes i smoked once that is so there so now you have told a lie into the bargain said the lawyer disguising his smile by a frown miss natalie saw you smoking twice that means that you have been caught doing three naughty things smoking taking tobacco that doesn t belong to you off my table and telling a lie three accusations comcore greatgatsby there was music from my neighbor s house through the summer nights in his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars at high tide in the afternoon i watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the sound drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam on week ends his rolls royce became an omnibus bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains and on mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing brushes and hammers and garden shears repairing the ravages of the night before every friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in new york every monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves there was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler s thumb at least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a christmas tree of gatsby s enormous garden on buffet tables garnished with glistening hors d oeuvres spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold in the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another by seven o clock the orchestra has arrived no thin five piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums the last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs the cars from new york are parked five deep in the drive and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair bobbed in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of castile the bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other s names the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher laughter is easier minute by minute spilled with prodigality tipped out at a cheerful word the groups change more swiftly swell with new arrivals dissolve and form in the same breath already there are wanderers confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable become for a sharp joyous moment the center of the group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal seizes a cocktail out of the air dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform a momentary hush the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly

runs straight as a plumb line worn smooth by feet and baked brick hard by july between the green rows of laidby cotton to the cottonhouse at four soft right angles and goes on across the field again

behind me looking straight ahead steps in a single stride through the window still staring straight ahead his pale eyes like wood set into his wooden face he crosses the floor in four strides with the

horizon never out of sight never landing until the watcher turns his eyes away in resignation his dreams mocked to death by time that is the life of men now women forget all those things they don t want to remember and remember everything they don t want to forget the dream is the truth then they act and do things accordingly so the beginning of this was a woman and she had come back from burying the dead not the dead of sick and ailing with friends at the pillow and the feet she had come back from the sodden and the bloated the sudden dead their eyes flung wide open in judgment the people all saw her come because it was sundown the sun was gone but he had left his footprints in the sky it was the time for sitting on porches beside the road it was the time to hear things and talk these sitters had been tongueless earless eyeless conveniences all day long mules and other brutes had occupied their skins but now the sun and the bossman were gone so the skins felt powerful and human they became lords of sounds and lesser things they passed nations through their mouths they sat in judgment seeing the woman as she was made them remember the envy they had stored up from other times so they chewed up the back parts of their minds and swallowed with relish they made burning statements with questions and killing tools out of laughs it was mass cruelty a mood come alive words

where they were she turned her face on the bander log and spoke they scrambled a noisy good evenin and left their mouths setting open and their ears full of hope her speech was pleasant enough but she kept walking straight on to her gate the porch couldn t talk for looking the men noticed her firm buttocks like she had grape fruits in her hip pockets the great rope of black hair swinging to her waist and unraveling in the wind like a plume then her pugnacious breasts trying to bore holes in her shirt they the men were saving with the mind what they lost with the eye the women took the faded shirt and muddy overalls and laid them away for remembrance it was a weapon against her strength and if it turned out of no significance still it was a hope that she might fall to their level some day but nobody moved nobody spoke nobody even thought to swallow spit until after her gate slammed behind her pearl stone opened her mouth and laughed real hard because she didn t know what else to do she

read i was jarred and shocked by the style the clear clean sweeping sentences why did he write like that and how did one write like that i pictured the man as a raging demon slashing with his pen consumed with hate denouncing everything american extolling everything european or german laughing at the weakness of people mocking god authority what was this i stood up trying to realize what reality lay behind the meaning of the words yes this man was fighting fighting with words he was using words as a weapon using them as one would use a club could words be weapons well yes for here they were then maybe perhaps i could use them as a weapon no it frightened me i read on and what amazed me was not what he said but how on earth anybody had the courage to say it occasionally i glance up to reassure myself that i was alone in the room who were these men about whom mencken was talking so passionately who was anatole france joseph conrad sinclair lewis sherwood anderson dostoevski

dreiser h g wells gogol t s eliot gide baudelaire edgar lee masters stendhal turgenev huneker nietzsche and scores of others were these men real did they exist or had they existed and how did one pronounce their names i ran across many words whose meanings i did not know and i either looked them up in a dictionary or before i had a chance to do that encountered the word in a context that made its meaning clear but what strange world was this i concluded the book with the conviction that i had somehow overlooked something terribly important in my life i had once tried to write had once reveled in feeling had let my crude imagination roam but the impulse to dream had been slowly beaten out of me by experience now it surged up again and i hungered for books new ways of looking and seeing it was not a matter of believing or disbelieving what i read but of feeling something new of being affected by something that made the look of the world different as dawn broke i ate my pork and beans feeling dopey sleepy i went to work but the mood of the book would not die it lingered coloring everything i saw heard did i now felt that i knew what the white men were feeling merely because i had read a book that had spoken of how they lived and thought i identified myself with that book i felt vaguely guilty would i filled with bookish notions act in a manner that would make the whites dislike me i forged more notes and my trips to the library became frequent reading grew into a passion comcore adventuresofaugie i haven t been wasting my time he said i ve been working on something i think i m getting married soon he said and didn t allow himself to smile with the announcement or temper it in some pleasant way when to whom to a woman with money a woman an older woman that was how i interpreted it well what s the matter with you yes i d marry an older woman why not i bet you wouldn t he was still able to amaze me as though we had remained kids we don t have to argue about it because she s not old she s about twenty two i m told by whom and you haven t even seen her no i haven t you remember the buyer my old boss he s fixing me up i have her picture she s not bad heavy but i m getting heavy too she s sort of pretty anyhow even if she weren t pretty and if the buyer isn t lying about the dough her family is supposed to have a mountain of dough i d marry her you ve already made up your mind i ll say i have and suppose she doesn t want to marry you i ll see that she does don t you think i can maybe you can but i don t like it it s cold blooded cold blooded he said with sudden emotion what s cold blooded about it i d be cold blooded if i stayed as i am i see around this marriage and beyond it i ll never again go for all the nonsense about marriage everybody you lay eyes on except perhaps a few like you and me is born of marriage do you see anything so exceptional or wonderful about it that it makes it such a big deal why be fooling around to make this perfect great marriage what s it going to save you from has it saved anybody the jerks the fools the morons the schleppers the jag offs the monkeys rats rabbits or the decent unhappy people or what you call nice people they re all married or are born of marriages so how can you pretend to me that it makes a difference that bob loves mary who loves jerry that s for the movies don t you see people pondering how to marry for love and getting the blood gypped out of them because while they re looking for the best there is and i figure that s what s wrong with you everything else gets lost it s sad it s a pity but it s that way i was all the same strongly against him that he saw even if i couldn t just then consider myself on the active list of lovers and wasn t carrying a live torch any more for esther fenchel i recognized his face as the face of a man in the wrong comcore bluesteye one winter pauline discovered she was pregnant when she told cholly he surprised her by being pleased he began to drink less and come home more often they eased back into a relationship more like the early days of their marriage when he asked if she were tired or wanted him to bring her something from the store in this state of ease pauline stopped doing day work and returned to her own housekeeping but the loneliness in those two rooms had not gone away when the winter sun hit the peeling green paint of the kitchen chairs when the smoked hocks were boiling in the pot when all she could hear was the truck delivering furniture downstairs she thought about back home about how she had been all alone most of the time then too but that this lonesomeness was different then she stopped staring at the green chairs at the delivery truck she went to the movies instead there in the dark her memory was refreshed and she succumbed to her earlier dreams along with the idea of romantic love she was introduced to another physical beauty probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought both originated in envy thrived in insecurity and ended in disillusion in equating physical beauty with virtue she stripped her mind bound it and collected self contempt by the heap she forgot lust and simple caring for she regarded love as possessive mating and romance as the goal of the spirit it would be for her a well spring from which she would draw the most destructive emotions deceiving the lover and seeking to imprison the beloved curtailing freedom in every way she was never able after her education in the movies to look at a face and not assign it some category in the scale of absolute beauty and the scale was one she absorbed in full from the silver screen there at last were the darkened woods the lonely roads the river banks the gentle knowing eyes there the flawed became whole the blind sighted and the lame and halt threw away their crutches there death was dead and people made every gesture in a cloud of music there the black and white images came together making a magnificent whole all projected through the ray of light from above and beyond it was really a simple pleasure but she learned all there was to love and all there was to hate comcore dreamingincuban abuela gives me a box of letters she wrote to her onetime lover in spain but never sent she shows me his photograph too it s very well preserved he d be

recites them quite dramatically i ve started dreaming in spanish which has never happened before i wake up feeling different like something inside me is changing something chemical and irreversible

growing from the trunks of the mysterious ceiba trees and i love havanna its noise and decay and painted ladyness i could happily sit on one of those wrought iron balconies for days or keep my grandmother company on her porch with its ringside view of the sea i m afraid to lose all this to lose abuela celia again but i know that sooner or later i d have to return to new york i know now it s

obligated to attend one of the presenters on the panel amit is a distant cousin who lives in bombay whom gogol has never met his mother has asked him to greet amit on her behalf gogol is bored by the panelists who keep referring to something called marginality as if it were some sort of medical condition for most of the hour he sketches portraits of the panelists who sit hunched over their papers along a rectangular table teleologically speaking abcds are unable to answer the question where are you from the sociologist on the panel declares gogol has never heard the term abcd he eventually gathers that it stands for american born confused deshi in other words him he learns that the c could also stand for conflicted he knows that deshi a generic word for countryman means indian knows that his parents and all their friends always refer to india simply as desh but gogol never thinks of india as desh he thinks of it as americans do as india gogol slouches in his seat and ponders certain awkward truths for instance although he can understand his mother tongue and speak it fluently he cannot read or write it with even modest proficiency on trips to india his american accented english is a source of endless amusement to his relatives and when he and sonia speak to each other aunts and uncles and cousins always shake their heads in disbelief and say i didn t understand a word living with a pet name and a good name in a place where such distinctions do not exist surely that was emblematic of the greatest confusion of all he searches the audience for someone he knows but it isn t his crowd lots of lit majors with leather satchels and gold rimmed glasses and fountain pens lots of people ruth would have waved to there are also lots of abcds he has no idea there are this many on campus he has no abcd friends at college he avoids them for they remind him too much of the way his parents choose to live befriending people not so much because they like them but because of a past they happen to share gogol why aren t you a member of the indian association here amit asks later when they go for a drink at the anchor i just don t have the time gogol says not telling his well meaning cousin that he can think of no greater hypocrisy than joining an organization that willingly celebrates occasions his parents forced him throughout his childhood and adolescence to attend i m nikhil now gogol says suddenly depressed by how many more times he will have to say this asking people to remember reminding them to forget feeling as if an errata slip were perpetually pinned to his chest comcore declarationindependence in congress july the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws of naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands he has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers he has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighbouring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever he has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people nor have we been wanting in attention to our british brethren we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity we must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as free and independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor comcore crisis these are the times that try men s souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives every thing its value heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has declared that she has a right not only to tax but to bind us in all cases whatsoever and if being bound in that manner is not slavery then is there not such a thing as slavery upon earth even the expression is impious for so unlimited a power can belong only to god whether the independence of the continent was declared too soon or delayed too long i will not now enter into as an argument my own simple opinion is that had it been eight months earlier it would have been much better we did not make a proper use of last winter neither could we while we were in a dependent state however the fault if it were one was all our own we have none to blame but ourselves but no great deal is lost yet all that howe has been doing for this month past is rather a ravage than a conquest which the spirit of the jerseys a year ago would have quickly repulsed and which time and a little resolution will soon recover the present winter is worth an age if rightly employed but if lost or neglected the whole continent will partake of the evil and there is no punishment that man does not deserve be he who or what or where he will that may be the means of sacrificing a season so precious and useful i have as little superstition in me as any man living but my secret opinion has ever been and still is that god almighty will not give up a people to military destruction or leave them unsupportedly to perish who have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities of war by every decent method which wisdom could invent neither have i so much of the infidel in me as to suppose that he has relinquished the government of the world and given us up to the care of devils and as i do not i cannot see on what grounds the king of britain can look up to heaven for help against us a common murderer a highwayman or a house breaker has as good a pretence as he comcore walden i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartan like as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion for most men it appears to me are in a strange uncertainty about it whether it is of the devil or of god and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify god and enjoy him forever comcore societysolitude it is hard to mesmerize ourselves to whip our own top but through sympathy we are capable of energy and endurance concert fires people to a certain fury of performance they can rarely reach alone here is the use of society it is so easy with the great to be great so easy to come up to an existing standard as easy as it is to the lover to swim to his maiden through waves so grim before the benefits of affection are immense and the one event which never loses its romance is the encounter with superior persons on terms allowing the happiest intercourse it by no means follows that we are not fit for society because soirees are tedious and because the soiree finds us tedious a backwoodsman who had been sent to the university told me that when he heard the best bred young men at the law school talk together he reckoned himself a boor but whenever he caught them apart and had one to himself alone then they were the boors and he the better man and if we recall the rare hours when we encountered the best persons we then found ourselves and then first society seemed to exist that was society though in the transom of a brig or on the florida keys a cold sluggish blood thinks it has not facts enough to the purpose and must decline its turn in the conversation but they who speak have no more have less it is not new facts that avail but the heat to dissolve everybody s facts the capital defect of cold arid natures is the want of animal spirits they seem a power incredible as if god should raise the dead the recluse witnesses what others perform by their aid with a kind of fear it is as much out of his possibility as the prowess of coeur de lion or an irishman s day s work on the railroad it is said the present and the future are always rivals animal spirits constitute the power of the present and their feats are like the structure of a pyramid their result is a lord a general or a boon companion before these what a base mendicant is memory with his leathern badge but this genial heat is latent in all constitutions and is disengaged only by the friction of society as bacon said of manners to obtain them it only needs not to despise them so we say of animal spirits that they are the spontaneous product of health and of a social habit for behavior men learn it as they take diseases one of another but the people are to be taken in very small doses if solitude is proud so is society vulgar in society high advantages are set down to the individual as disqualifications we sink as easily as we rise through sympathy so many men whom i know are degraded by their sympathies their native aims being high enough but their relation all too tender to the gross people about them men cannot afford to live together by their merits and they adjust themselves by their demerits by their love of gossip or by sheer tolerance and animal good nature they untune and dissipate the brave aspirant the remedy is to reinforce each of these moods from the other conversation will not corrupt us if we come to the assembly in our own garb and speech and with the energy of health to select what is ours and reject what is not society we must have but let it be society and not exchanging news or eating from the same dish is it society to sit in one of your chairs i cannot go into the houses of my nearest relatives because i do not wish to be alone society exists by chemical affinity and not otherwise put any company of people together with freedom for conversation and a rapid self distribution takes place into sets and pairs the best are accused of exclusiveness it would be more true to say they separate as oil from water as children from old people without love or hatred in the matter each seeking his like and any interference with the affinities would produce constraint and suffocation all conversation is a magnetic experiment i know that my friend can talk eloquently you know that he cannot articulate a sentence we have seen him in different company assort your party or invite none put stubbs and coleridge quintilian and aunt miriam into pairs and you make them all wretched tis an extempore sing sing built in a parlor leave them to seek their own mates and they will be as merry as sparrows a higher civility will re establish in our customs a certain reverence which we have lost what to do with these brisk young men who break through all fences and make themselves at home in every house i find out in an instant if my companion does not want me and ropes cannot hold me when my welcome is gone one would think that the affinities would pronounce themselves with a surer reciprocity here again as so often nature delights to put us between extreme antagonisms and our safety is in the skill with which we keep the diagonal line solitude is impracticable and society fatal we must keep our head in the one and our hands in the other the conditions are met if we keep our independence yet do not lose our sympathy these wonderful horses need to be driven by fine hands we require such a solitude as shall hold us to its revelations when we are in the street and in palaces for most men are cowed in society and say good things to you in private but will not stand to them in public but let us not be the victims of words society and solitude are deceptive names it is not the circumstance of seeing more or fewer people but the readiness of sympathy that imports and a sound mind will derive its principles from insight with ever a purer ascent to the sufficient and absolute right and will accept society as the natural element in which they are to be applied comcore fallacysuccess there has appeared in our time a particular class of books and articles which i sincerely and solemnly think may be called the silliest ever known among men they are much more wild than the wildest romances of chivalry and much more dull than the dullest religious tract moreover the romances of chivalry were at least about chivalry the religious tracts are about religion but these things are about nothing they are about what is called success on every bookstall in every magazine you may find works telling people how to succeed they are books showing men how to succeed in everything they are written by men who cannot even succeed in writing books to begin with of course there is no such thing as success or if you like to put it so there is nothing that is not successful that a thing is successful merely means that it is a millionaire is successful in being a millionaire and a donkey in being a donkey any live man has succeeded in living any dead man may have succeeded in committing suicide but passing over the bad logic and bad philosophy in the phrase we may take it as these writers do in the ordinary sense of success in obtaining money or worldly position these writers profess to tell the ordinary man how he may succeed in his trade or speculation how if he is a builder he may succeed as a builder how if he is a stockbroker he may succeed as a stockbroker they profess to show him how if he is a grocer he may become a sporting yachtsman how if he is a tenth rate journalist he may become a peer and how if he is a german jew he may become an anglo saxon this is a definite and business like proposal and i really think that the people who buy these books if any people do buy them have a moral if not a legal right to ask for their money back nobody would dare to publish a book about electricity which literally told one nothing about electricity no one would dare publish an article on botany which showed that the writer did not know which end of a plant grew in the earth yet our modern world is full of books about success and successful people which literally contain no kind of idea and scarcely and kind of verbal sense it is perfectly obvious that in any decent occupation such as bricklaying or writing books there are only two ways in any special sense of succeeding one is by doing very good work the other is by cheating both are much too simple to require any literary explanation if you are in for the high jump either jump higher than any one else or manage somehow to pretend that you have done so if you want to succeed at whist either be a good whist player or play with marked cards you may want a book about jumping you may want a book about whist you may want a book about cheating at whist but you cannot want a book about success especially you cannot want a book about success such as those which you can now find scattered by the hundred about the book market you may want to jump or to play cards but you do not want to read wandering statements to the effect that jumping is jumping or that games are won by winners if these writers for instance said anything about success in jumping it would be something like this the jumper must have a clear aim before him he must desire definitely to jump higher than the other men who are in for the same competition he must let no feeble feelings of mercy sneaked from the sickening little englanders and pro boers prevent him from trying to do his best he must remember that a competition in jumping is distinctly competitive and that as darwin has gloriously demonstrated the weakest go to the wall that is the kind of thing the book would say and very useful it would be no doubt if read out in a low and tense voice to a young man just about to take the high jump or suppose that in the course of his intellectual rambles the philosopher of success dropped upon our other case that of playing cards his bracing advice would run in playing cards it is very necessary to avoid the mistake commonly made by maudlin humanitarians and free traders of permitting your opponent to win the game you must have grit and snap and go in to win the days of idealism and superstition are over we live in a time of science and hard common sense and it has now been definitely proved that in any game where two are playing if one does not win the other will it is all very stirring of course but i confess that if i were playing cards i would rather have some decent little book which told me the rules of the game beyond the rules of the game it is all a question either of talent or dishonesty and i will undertake to provide either one or the other which it is not for me to say comcore americanlanguage what chiefly lies behind slang is simply a kind of linguistic exuberance an excess of word making energy it relates itself to the standard language a great deal as dancing relates itself to music but there is also something else the best slang is not only ingenious and amusing it also embodies a kind of social criticism it not only provides new names for a series of every day concepts some new and some old it also says something about them words which produce the slang effect observes frank sechrist arouse associations what are incongruous or incompatible with those of customary thinking everyone including the metaphysician in his study or the eremite in his cell has a large vocabulary of slang but the vocabulary of the vulgar is likely to be larger than that of the cultured and it is harder worked its content may be divided into two categories a old words whether used singly or in combination that have been put to new uses usually metaphorical and b new words that have not yet been admitted to the standard vocabulary examples of the first type are rubberneck for a gaping and prying person and iceberg for a cold woman examples of the second are hoosegow flim flam blurb bazoo and blah there is a constant movement of slang into accepted usage nice as an adjective of all work signifying anything satisfactory was once used in slang only but today no one would question a nice day a nice time or a nice hotel the verb phrase to hold up is now perfectly good american but so recently as the late brander matthews was sneering at it as slang in the same way many other verb phrases e g to cave in fill the bill and to fly off the handle once viewed askance have gradually worked their way to a relatively high level of the standard speech on some indeterminate tomorrow to stick up and to take for a ride may follow them comcore politicsandenglishlanguage most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the english language is in a bad way but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it our civilization is decadent and our language so the argument runs must inevitably share in the general collapse it follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes underneath this lies the half conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes now it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer but an effect can become a cause reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form and so on indefinitely a man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure and then fail all the more completely because he drinks it is rather the same thing that is happening to the english language it becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts the point is that the process is reversible modern english especially written english is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble if one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration so that the fight against bad english is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers i will come back to this presently and i hope that by that time the meaning of what i have said here will have become clearer meanwhile here are five specimens of the english language as it is now habitually written these five passages have not been picked out because they are especially bad i could have quoted far worse if i had chosen but because they illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer they are a little below the average but are fairly representative examples i number them so that i can refer back to them when necessary i am not indeed sure whether it is not true to say that the milton who once seemed not unlike a seventeenth century shelley had not become out of

apart from avoidable ugliness two qualities are common to all of them the first is staleness of imagery the other is lack of precision the writer either has a meaning and cannot express it or he inadvertently says something else or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not this mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern english prose and especially of any kind of political writing as soon as certain topics are raised the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen house comcore alincolnandselfmademyth lincoln was shaken by the presidency back in springfield politics had been a sort of exhilarating game but in the white house politics was power and power was responsibility never before had lincoln held executive office in public life he had always been an insignificant legislator whose votes were cast in concert with others and whose decisions in themselves had neither finality nor importance as president he might consult with others but innumerable grave decisions were in the end his own and with them came a burden of responsibility terrifying in its dimensions lincolns rage for personal success his external and worldly ambition was quieted when he entered the white house and he was at last left alone to reckon with himself to be confronted with the fruits of his victory only to find that it meant choosing between life and death for others was immensely sobering that lincoln should have shouldered the moral burden of the war was characteristic of the high seriousness into which he had grown since and it may be true as professor charles w ramsdell suggested that he was stricken by an awareness of his own part in whipping up the crisis this would go far to explain the desperation with which he issued pardons and the charity that he wanted to extend to the conquered south at the wars close in one of his rare moments of self revelation he is

and as tender lincoln was moved by the wounded and dying men moved as no one in a place of power can afford to be he had won high office by means sometimes rugged but once there he found that he could not quite carry it off for him it was impossible to drift into the habitual callousness of the sort of officialdom that sees men only as pawns to be shifted here and there and expended at the will of others it was a symbolic thing that his office was so constantly open that he made himself more accessible than any other chief executive in our history men moving only in an official circle he told carpenter are apt to become merely official not to say arbitrary in their ideas and are apter and apter with each passing day to forget that they only hold power in a representative capacity is it possible to recall anyone else in modern history who could exercise so much power and yet feel so slightly the private corruption that goes with it here perhaps is the best measure of lincolns personal eminence in the human calendar that he was chastened and not intoxicated by power comcore mothertongue just last week i was walking down the street with my mother and i again found myself conscious of the english i was using the english i do use with her we were talking about the price of new and used furniture and i heard myself saying this not waste money that way my husband was with us as well and he didnt notice any switch in my english and then i realized why its because over the twenty years weve been together ive often used that same kind of english with him and sometimes he even uses it with me it has become our language of intimacy a different sort of english that relates to family talk the language i grew up with so youll have some idea of what this family talk i heard sounds like i quote what my mother said during a recent conversation which i videotaped and then transcribed during this conversation my mother was talking about a political gangster in shanghai who had the same last name as her familys du and how the gangster in his early years wanted to be adopted by her family which was rich by comparison later the gangster became more powerful far richer than my mothers family and one day showed up at my mothers wedding to pay his respects heres what she said in part du yusong having business like fruit stand like off the street kind he is du like du zong but not tsung ming island people the local people call putong the river east side he belong to that side local people that man want to ask du zong father take him in like become own family du zong father wasnt look down on him but didnt take seriously until that man big like become a mafia now important person very hard to inviting him chinese way came only to show respect dont stay for dinner respect for making big celebration he shows up mean gives lots of respect chinese custom chinese social life that way if too important wont have to stay too long he come to my wedding i didnt see i heard it i gone to boys side they have ymca dinner chinese age i was nineteen you should know that my mothers expressive command of english belies how much she actually understands she reads the forbes report listens to wall street week converses daily with her stockbroker reads all of shirley maclaines books with ease all kinds of things i cant begin to understand yet some of my friends tell me they understand percent of what my mother says some say they understand to percent some say they understand none of it as if she were speaking pure chinese but to me my mothers english is perfectly clear perfectly natural its my mother tongue her language as i hear it is vivid direct full of observation and imagery that was the language that helped shape the way i saw things expressed things made sense of the world lately ive been giving more thought to the kind of english my mother speaks like others i have described it to people as broken or fractured english but i wince when i say that it has always bothered me that i can think of no way to describe it other than broken as if it were damaged and needed to be fixed as if it lacked a certain wholeness and soundness ive heard other terms used limited english for example but they seem just as bad as if everything is limited including peoples perceptions of the limited english speaker i know this for a fact because when i was growing up my mothers limited english limited my perception of her i was ashamed of her english i believed that her english reflected the quality of what she had to say that is because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect and i had plenty of empirical evidence to support me the fact that people in department stores at banks and at restaurants did not take her seriously did not give her good service pretended not to understand her or even acted as if they did not hear her my mother has long realized the limitations of her english as well when i was fifteen she used to have me call people on the phone to pretend i was she in this guise i was forced to ask for information or even to complain and yell at people who had been rude to her one time it was a call to her stockbroker in new york she had cashed out her small portfolio and it just so happened we were going to go to new york the next week our very first trip outside california i had to get on the phone and say in an adolescent voice that was not very convincing this is mrs tan and my mother was standing in the back whispering loudly why he dont send me check already two weeks late so mad he lie to me losing me money and then i said in perfect english yes im getting rather concerned you had agreed to send the check two weeks ago but it hasnt arrived then she began to talk more loudly what he want i come to new york tell him front of his boss you cheating me and i was trying to calm her down make her be quiet while telling the stockbroker i cant tolerate any more excuses if i dont receive the check immediately i am going to have to speak to your manager when im in new york next week and sure enough the following week there we were in front of this astonished stockbroker and i was sitting there red faced and quiet and my mother the real mrs tan was shouting at his boss in her impeccable broken english comcore taketortillas in a recent lecture is nothing sacred salman rushdie one of the most censored authors of our time talked about the importance of books he grew up in a household in india where books were as sacred as bread if anyone in the household dropped a piece of bread or a book the person not only picked it up but also kissed the object by way of apologizing for clumsy disrespect he goes on to say that he had kissed many books before he had kissed a girl bread and books were for his household and for many like his food for the body and the soul this image of the kissing of the book one had accidentally dropped made an impression on me it speaks to the love and respect many people have for them i grew up in a small town in new mexico and we had very few books in our household the first one i remember reading was my catechism book before i went to school to learn english my mother taught me catechism in spanish i remember the questions and answers i had to learn and i remember the well thumbed frayed volume which was sacred to me growing up with few books in the house created in me a desire and a need for them when i started school i remember visiting the one room library of our town and standing in front of the dusty shelves in reality there were only a few shelves and not over a thousand books but i wanted to read them all there was food for my soul in the books that much i realized as a child i listened to the stories of the people the cuentos the old ones told those stories were my first contact with the magic of storytelling those stories fed my imagination and later when i wrote books i found the same sense of magic and mystery in writing in bless me ultima my first novel antonio my main character who had just started to school sees in them the power of the written word he calls books the magic of words for me

george orwell s finest essays takes charles dickens to task for his lack of constructive suggestions dickens was a powerful critic of victorian england a proud and lonely voice in the campaign for social reform but as orwell points out there was little substance to dickens s complaints he attacks the law parliamentary government the educational system and so forth without ever clearly suggesting what he would put in their places orwell writes there is no clear sign that he wants the existing order to be overthrown or that he believes it would make very much difference if it were overthrown for in reality his target is not so much society as human nature dickens sought a change of spirit rather than a change in structure orwell didn t think that dickens should have written different novels he loved dickens but he understood that dickens bore the ideological marks of his time and place his class did not see the english social order as tyrannical worthy of being overthrown dickens thought that large contradictions could be tamed through small moments of justice he believed in the power of changing hearts and that s what you believe in orwell says if you do not wish to endanger the status quo but in cases where the status quo involves systemic injustice this is no more than a temporary strategy eventually such injustice requires more than a change of

have made will suffice to display the character of anglo american civilization in its true light it is the result and this should be constantly present to the mind of two distinct elements which in other places have been in frequent hostility but which in america have been admirably incorporated and combined with one another i allude to the spirit of religion and the spirit of liberty the settlers of new england were at the same time ardent sectarians and daring innovators narrow as the limits of some of their religious opinions were they were entirely free from political prejudices hence arose two tendencies distinct but not opposite which are constantly discernible in the manners as well as in the laws of the country it might be imagined that men who sacrificed their friends their family and their native land to a religious conviction were absorbed in the pursuit of the intellectual advantages which they purchased at so dear a rate the energy however with which they strove for the acquirement of wealth moral enjoyment and the comforts as well as liberties of the world is scarcely inferior to that with which they devoted themselves to heaven political principles and all human laws and institutions were moulded and altered at their pleasure the barriers of the society in which they were born were broken down before them the old principles which had governed the world for ages were no more a path without a turn and a field without an horizon were opened to the exploring and ardent curiosity of man but at the limits of the political world he checks his researches he discreetly lays aside the use of his most formidable faculties he no longer consents to doubt or to innovate but carefully abstaining from raising the curtain of the sanctuary he yields with submissive respect to truths which he will not discuss thus in the moral world everything is classed adapted decided and foreseen in the political world everything is agitated uncertain and disputed in the one is a passive though a voluntary obedience in the other an independence scornful of experience and jealous of authority these two tendencies apparently so discrepant are far from conflicting they advance together and mutually support each other religion perceives that civil liberty affords a noble exercise to the faculties of man and that the political world is a field prepared by the creator for the efforts of the intelligence contented with the freedom and the power which it enjoys in its own sphere and with the place which it occupies the empire of religion is never more surely established than when it reigns in the hearts of men unsupported by aught beside its native strength religion is no less the companion of liberty in all its battles and its triumphs the cradle of its infancy and the divine source of its claims the safeguard of morality is religion and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of freedom comcore declarationsentiments when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto occupied but one to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such a course we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it and to insist upon the institution of a new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which

first right of a citizen the elective franchise thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation he has oppressed her on all sides he has made her if married in the eye of the law civilly dead he has taken from her all right in property even to the wages she earns he has made her morally an irresponsible being as she can commit many crimes with impunity provided they be done in the presence of her husband in the covenant of marriage she is compelled to promise obedience to her husband he becoming to all intents and purposes her master the law giving him power to deprive her of her liberty and to administer chastisement he has so framed the laws of divorce as to what shall be the proper causes and in case of separation to whom the guardianship of the children

of all rights as a married woman if single and the owner of property he has taxed her to support a government which recognizes her only when her property can be made profitable to it he has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments and from those she is permitted to follow she receives but a scanty remuneration he closes against her all the avenues to wealth and distinction which he considers most honorable to himself as a teacher of theology medicine or law she is not known he has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education all colleges being closed against her he allows her in church as well as state but a subordinate position claiming apostolic authority for her exclusion from the ministry and with some exceptions from any public participation in the affairs of the church he has created a false public sentiment by giving to the world a different code of morals for men and women by which moral delinquencies which exclude women from society are not only tolerated but deemed of little account in man he has usurped the prerogative of jehovah himself claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action when that belongs to her conscience

the claims of gratitude that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits who so stolid and selfish that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation s jubilee when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs i am not that man in a case like that the dumb might eloquently speak and the lame man leap as an hart but such is not the state of the case i say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us i am not included within the pale of glorious anniversary your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us the blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common the rich inheritance of justice liberty prosperity and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you not by me the sunlight that brought light and healing to you has brought stripes and death to me this fourth july is yours not mine you may rejoice i must mourn to drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony do you mean citizens to mock me by asking me to speak to day if so there is a parallel to your conduct and let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes towering up to heaven were thrown down by the breath of the almighty burying that nation in irrevocable ruin i can to day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe smitten people by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they who wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion how can we sing the lord s song in a strange land if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth fellow citizens above your national tumultuous joy i hear the mournful wail of millions whose chains heavy and grievous yesterday are to day rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them if i do forget if i do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day may my right hand forget her cunning and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth to forget them to pass lightly over their wrongs and to chime in with the popular theme would be treason most scandalous and shocking and would make me a reproach before god and the world my subject then fellow citizens is american slavery i shall see this day and its popular characteristics from the slave s point of view standing there identified with the american bondman making his wrongs mine i do not hesitate to declare with all my soul that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this th of july whether we turn to the declarations of the past or to the professions of the present the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting america is false to the past false to the present and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future standing with god and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion i will in the name of humanity which is outraged in the name of liberty which is fettered in the name of the constitution and the bible which are disregarded and trampled upon dare to call in question and to denounce with all the emphasis i can command everything that serves to perpetuate slavery the great sin and shame of america i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will use the severest language i can command and yet not one word shall escape me that any man whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice or who is not at heart a slaveholder shall not confess to be right and just but i fancy i hear some one of my audience say it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind would you argue more an denounce less would you persuade more and rebuke less your cause would be much more likely to succeed but i submit where all is plain there is nothing to be argued what point in the anti slavery creed would you have me argue on what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light must i undertake to prove that the slave is a man that point is conceded already nobody doubts it the slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government they acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave there are seventy two crimes in the state of virginia which if committed by a black man no matter how ignorant he be subject him to the punishment of death while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment what is this but the acknowledgment that the slave is a moral intellectual and responsible being the manhood of the slave is conceded it is admitted in the fact that southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding under severe fines and penalties the teaching of the slave to read or to write when you can point to any such laws in reference to the beasts of the field then i may consent to argue the manhood of the slave when the dogs in your streets when the fowls of the air when the cattle on your hills when the fish of the sea and the reptiles that crawl shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute then will i argue with you that the slave is a man for the present it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the negro race is it not astonishing that while we are ploughing planting and reaping using all kinds of mechanical tools erecting houses constructing bridges building ships working in metals of brass iron copper silver and gold that while we are reading writing and ciphering acting as clerks merchants and secretaries having among us lawyers doctors ministers poets authors editors orators and teachers that while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men digging gold in california capturing the whale in the pacific feeding sheep and cattle on the hill side living moving acting thinking planning living in families as husbands wives and children and above all confessing and worshipping the christian s god and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave we are called upon to prove that we are men would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty that he is the rightful owner of his own body you have already declared it must i argue the wrongfulness of slavery is that a question for republicans is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation as a matter beset with great difficulty involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice hard to be understood how should i look to day in the presence of americans dividing and subdividing a discourse to show that men have a natural right to freedom speaking of it relatively and positively negatively and affirmatively to do so would be to make myself ridiculous and to offer an insult to your understanding there is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven that does not know that slavery is wrong for him what am i to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes to rob them of their liberty to work them without wages to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men to beat them with sticks to flay their flesh with the lash to load their limbs with irons to hunt them with dogs to sell them at auction to sunder their families to knock out their teeth to burn their flesh to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters must i argue that a system thus marked with blood and stained with pollution is wrong no i will not i have better employment for my time and strength than such arguments would imply what then remains to be argued is it that slavery is not divine that god did not establish it that our doctors of divinity are mistaken there is blasphemy in the thought that which is inhuman cannot be divine who can reason on such a proposition they that can may i cannot the time for such argument is passed at a time like this scorching irony not convincing argument is needed o had i the ability and could reach the nation s ear i would to day pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule blasting reproach withering sarcasm and stern rebuke for it is not light that is needed but fire it is not the gentle shower but thunder we need the storm the whirlwind and the earthquake the feeling of the nation must be quickened the conscience of the nation must be roused the propriety of the nation must be startled the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed and its crimes against god and man must be proclaimed and denounced what to the american slave is your th of

an unholy license your national greatness swelling vanity your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence your shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery your prayers and hymns your sermons and thanksgivings with all your religious parade and solemnity are to him mere bombast fraud deception impiety and hypocrisy a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages there is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the united states at this very hour go where you may search where you will roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world travel through south america search out every abuse and when you have found the last lay your facts by the

been established throughout the united states during the next fifty years however there was a movement toward more schooling for more students in part this was a result of the development of public high schools although such schools had existed since the early nineteenth century they began to enroll a significant proportion of young people only at the turn of the century inpercent of the nations youth between fourteen and seventeen years of age enrolled in school a figure that rose by to percent reflecting the realization that schooling was an alternative to early employment the social worker florence kelley observed that the most effective compulsory education law was a child labor law byall states had some form of compulsory school attendance at the same time that schooling was being extended upward it was moving downward to encompass more and more young children never constant the age of school entry declined as kindergartens were being added to an increasing number of school systems developed by the prussian educator friedrich froebel kindergartens were intended to teach children between the ages of thee and seven to work to cooperate with one another and to appreciate the spiritual unity of all things kindergartens spread rapidly in the united states initially operating under private auspices the first kindergarten that was part of a public school system was opened by susan blow in st louis missouri in more than four thousand kindergartens were in operation by acceptance of the idea of early childhood education programs was encouraged by such influential american educators as the psychologist g stanley hall who was a critical figure in the child study movement that began in the s and the psychologist and philosopher john dewey whose early writings focused attention on the need to organize schools in harmony with the interests and capacities of children at a time of significant immigration and heightened concern with urban poverty early

house of representatives offered a clean slate on which to draft in individual states any rationalistic reapportionment proposal had to overcome established usages and entrenched interests of lawmakers and the localities they represented no comparably entrenched federal apportionment system existed the result was a clever combination of new world wheels and gadgets less than twenty years after the famous american clockmaker david rittenhouse unveiled his mechanical orrery modeling the precise dimensions of the solar system in motion the philadelphia delegates offered their own constitutional clockwork designed to make the american house replicate in miniature the movements of the american people in macro the proposed machinery of regular elections regular enumerations and regular reapportionments based solely on population exemplified eighteenth century innovation at its best three fifths and also at its worst lets begin with two tiny puzzles posed by the article i command that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states by adding to the whole number of free persons three fifths of all other persons first although this language specified the apportionment formula among the several states it failed to specify the formula within each state a second small puzzle why did article i peg the number of representatives to the underlying number of persons instead of the underlying number of eligible voters a la new york these two small problems centering on the seemingly innocent words among and persons quickly spiral out into the most vicious words of the apportionment clause adding three fifths of all other persons other persons here meant other than free persons that is slaves thus the more slaves a given states master class bred or bought the more seats the state could claim in congress for every decade in perpetuity the philadelphia draftsmen camouflaged this ugly point as best they could euphemistically avoiding the s word and simultaneously introducing the t word taxes into the equation representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned the full import of the camouflaged clause eluded many readers in the late s in the wake of two decades of debate about taxation and burdens under the empire and confederation many founding era americans confronting the clause focused on taxation rather than on representation some northern critics grumbled that three fifths should have been five fifths so as to oblige the south to pay more taxes without noticing that five fifths would have also enabled the south to gain more house seats modern laypersons and law students confronting the words three fifths for the first time often suffer a similar confusion recoiling at the idea of valuing slaves at less than percent this initial reaction misses the point the clause did not mean to apportion how much a slave was a person as opposed to chattel had this been the question the antislavery answer in the s would have been to value slaves fully five fifths yet in the context of house apportionment a five fifths formula would not have freed a single slave or endowed any bondsman with more rights of personhood against his master or the world five fifths would simply have given slave states even more voting power vis a vis free states the precise article i question concerned congresss proportions not the slaves the principled antislavery answer to this question in was that for legislative apportionment purposes slaves should be valued not at five fifths or even three fifths but rather at zero fifths comcore on januarytwo weeks into the new year george washington wrote one of the most forlorn despairing letters of his life he had been suffering sleepless nights in the big

no matter how huge can be exceeded by adding together sufficiently many of any smaller number no matter how tiny though obvious in principle the consequences are sometimes resisted as they were by the student of mine who maintained that human hair just didn t grow in miles per hour unfortunately the nanoseconds used up in a simple computer operation do add up to lengthy bottlenecks on intractable problems many of which would require millennia to solve in general it takes some getting accustomed to the fact that the minuscule times and distances of microphysics as well as the vastness of astronomical phenomena share the dimensions of our human world it s clear how the above property of numbers led to archimedes famous pronouncement that given a fulcrum a long enough lever and a place to stand he alone could physically lift the earth an awareness of the additivity of small quantities is lacking in innumerates who don t seem to believe that their little aerosol cans of hairspray could play any role in the depletion of the ozone layer of the atmosphere or that their individual automobile contributes anything to the problem of acid rain the pyramids impressive as they are were built a stone at a time over a period very much shorter than the five thousand to ten thousand years required to move the foot mount fuji by truck a similar but more classic calculation of this type was made by archimedes who estimated the number of grains of sand needed to fill up the earth and heavens though he didn t have exponential notation he invented something comparable and his calculations were essentially equivalent to the following interpreting the earth and heavens to be a sphere about the earth we observe that the number of grains of sand needed to fill it depends on the radius of the sphere and the coarseness of the sand assuming there are fifteen grains per linear inch there are x per planar inch and to the rd power grains per cubic inch since there are twelve inches per foot there are to the rd power cubic inches per cubic foot and thus to the rd power x to the rd power grains per cubic foot similarly there are x xgrains per cubic mile since the formula for the volume of a sphere is x pi x the cube of the radius the number of grains of sand needed to fill a sphere of radius one trillion miles approximately archimedes estimate is x pi x x to the rd power x to the rd power x this equals approximately to the th power grains of sand there is a sense of power connected with such calculations which is hard to explain but which somehow involves a mental encompassing of the world a more modern version is the calculation of the approximate number of subatomic bits that would fill up the universe this number plays the role of practical infinity for computer problems which are solvable but only theoretically the size of the universe is to be a little generous a sphere about billion light years in diameter to be even more generous and also to simplify the rough calculation assume it s a cube billion light years on a side protons and neutrons are about centimeters in diameter the archimedean question computer scientist donald knuth poses is how many little cubes centimeters in diameter the diameter of these nucleons would fit into the universe an easy calculation shows the number to be less than to the th power thus even if a computer the size of the universe had working parts that were smaller than nucleons it would contain fewer than to the th power such parts and thus computations on problems which require more parts wouldn t be possible perhaps surprisingly there are many such problems some of them quite ordinary and of practical importance a comparably tiny time unit is the amount of time required for light which travels atkilometers per second to traverse the length of one of the above tiny cubes whose edges are to the th power centimeters taking the universe to be about billion years old we determine that fewer than to the nd power such time units have passed since the beginning of time thus any computer calculation which requires more than to the nd power steps each of which is certainly going to require more time than our unit of time requires more time than the present history of this universe again there are many such problems taking a human being to be spherical and about a meter in diameter assume a person is squatting we end with some biologically revealing comparisons that are somewhat easier to visualize the size of a human cell is to that of a person as a person s size s to that of rhode

losing the tug of war for these and similarly mind warping ideas in twentieth century physics just blame albert einstein einstein hardly ever set foot in the laboratory he didn t test phenomena or use elaborate equipment he was a theorist who perfected the thought experiment in which you engage nature through your imagination inventing a situation or a model and then working out the consequences of some physical principle if as was the case for einstein a physicist s model is intended to represent the entire universe then manipulating the model should be tantamount to manipulating the universe itself observers and experimentalists can then go out and look for the phenomena predicted by that model if the model is flawed or if the theorists make a mistake in their calculations the observers will detect a mismatch between the model s predictions and the way things happen in the real universe that s the first cue to try again either by adjusting the old model or by creating a new one one

mysteriesmass physicists are hunting for an elusive particle that would reveal the presence of a new kind of field that permeates all of reality finding that higgs field will give us a more complete understanding about how the universe works most people think they know what mass is but they understand only part of the story for instance an elephant is clearly bulkier and weighs more than an ant even in the absence of gravity the elephant would have greater mass it would be harder to push and set in motion obviously the elephant is more massive because it is made of many more atoms than the ant is but what determines the masses of the individual atoms what about the elementary particles that make up the atoms what determines their masses indeed why do they even have mass we see that the problem of mass has two independent aspects first we need to learn how mass arises at all it turns out mass results from at least three different mechanisms which i will describe below a key player in physicists tentative theories about mass is a new kind of field that permeates all of reality called the higgs field elementary particle masses are thought to come about from the interaction with the higgs field if the higgs field exists theory demands that it have an associated particle the higgs boson using particle accelerators scientists are now hunting for the higgs the second aspect is that scientists want to know why different species of elementary particles have their specific quantities of mass their intrinsic masses span at least orders of magnitude but we do not yet know why that should be so see illustration on page for comparison an elephant and the smallest of ants differ by about orders of magnitude of mass what is mass isaac newton presented the earliest scientific definition of mass in in his landmark principia the quantity of matter is the measure of the same arising from its density and bulk conjointly that very basic definition was good enough for newton and other scientists for more than years they understood that science should proceed first by describing how things work and later by understanding why in recent years however the why of mass has become a research topic in physics understanding the meaning and origins of mass will complete and extend the standard model of particle physics the well established theory that describes the known elementary particles and their interactions it will also resolve mysteries such as dark matter which makes up about percent of the universe the foundation of our modern understanding of mass is far more intricate than newton s definition and is based on the standard model at the heart of the standard model is a mathematical function called a lagrangian which represents how the various particles interact from that function by following rules known as relativistic quantum theory physicists can calculate the behavior of the elementary particles including how they come together to form compound particles such as protons for both the elementary particles and the compound ones we can then calculate how they will respond to forces and for a force f we can write newton s equation f ma which relates the force the mass and the resulting acceleration the lagrangian tells us what to use for m here and that is what is meant by the mass of the particle but mass as we ordinarily understand it shows up in more than just f ma for example einstein s special relativity theory predicts that massless particles in a vacuum travel at the speed of light and that particles with mass travel more slowly in a way that can be calculated if we know their mass the laws of gravity predict that gravity acts on mass and energy as well in a precise manner the quantity m deduced from the lagrangian for each particle behaves correctly in all those ways just as we expect for a given mass fundamental particles have an intrinsic mass known as their rest mass those with zero rest mass are called massless for a compound particle the constituents rest mass and also their kinetic energy of motion and potential energy of interactions contribute to the particle s total mass energy and mass are related as described by einstein s famous equation e mc squared energy equals mass times the speed of light squared an example of energy contributing to mass occurs in the most familiar kind of matter in the universe the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei in stars planets people and all that we see these particles amount to to percent of the mass energy of the universe the standard model tells us that protons and neutrons are composed of elementary particles called quarks that are bound together by massless particles called gluons although the constituents are whirling around inside each proton from outside we see a proton as a coherent object with an intrinsic mass which is given by adding up the masses and energies of its constituents the standard model lets us calculate that nearly all the mass of protons and neutrons is from the kinetic energy of their constituent quarks and gluons the remainder is from the quarks rest mass thus about to percent of the entire universe almost all the familiar matter around us comes from the energy of motion of quarks and gluons in protons and neutrons comcore workingknowledge steer clear automakers are offering electronic stability

still take it as axiomatic that such growth promoting changes to a small number of cancer genes are the initial event and root cause of every human cancer for the past few years however prominent oncologists have increasingly challenged that theory no one questions that cancer is ultimately a disease of the dna but as biologists trace tumors to their roots they have discovered many other abnormalities at work inside the nuclei of cells that though not yet cancerous are headed that way whole chromosomes each containingor more genes are often lost or duplicated pieces of chromosomes are frequently scrambled truncated or fused together chemical additions to the dna or to the histone proteins around which it coils somehow silence important genes but in a reversible process quite different from mutation and scans of the genomes of malignant cells within tumors have found that they typically harbor myriad rare mutations rather than a handful of common generic alterations the accumulating evidence has spawned new hypotheses that compete with the standard dogma to explain what changes come first and which aberrations matter most in the decadelong transformation of a cell and its descendants from well behaved tissue to invasive tumor the challengers dispute the dominant view of the disease as the product of a defined genetic state they argue that it is more useful to think of cancer as the consequence of a chaotic process a combination of murphy s law and darwin s law anything that can go wrong will and in a competitive environment the most prolific variants will dominate despite that shared underlying principle the new theories make different predictions about what kind of treatments will work best some suggest that many cancers could be prevented altogether by better screening changes in diet and new drugs or even by old drugs such as aspirin other theories cast doubt on that hope \n"
